I don't only want to be a consumer that uses new technology, but instead strive to be a creator and researcher to explore the potentials technology holds. I find it fascinating to learn how computer systems work as we use them in our everyday lives. Therefore, a career in tech excites me as I can be on the front end of making the world a better place through technology.","The first memory of working well in a team reminded me of the Summer Guild Program that was held virtually through Mason this past summer. The program involved collaboration and learning JavaScript with all participants, and included a project we worked on in smaller groups. I feel that the positive and inclusive energy we had in our group made the experience so memorable. 

The assignment we had was to build an app that would benefit the education sector. Our final goal was to develop an app and create a presentation. We were all excellent members of the group and contributed to the final product equally. I contributed by making slides, drafting ideas for our app, and helping with our presentation plan. In addition, I believe I most significantly played the role of being the member who brought the team together as a friend group. I initialized sharing our socials and creating a group chat so we could have a support group after we finish the program. 

As part of the program, we also had mentors visit us from tech companies to talk about their experience and guide us through the process of building an app. I enjoyed meeting our mentors and looked forward to this hour during the week. At the end of the program, I suggested to my team we send a thank you email to our mentors for their time spent helping us. I emailed our mentors and cc'd my team members and am happy that we could express our gratitude collectively to our mentors.

Looking back, something I would have done differently is leading my group in creating a connection closer to the beginning. It took us a while to feel comfortable because we were all shy and hesitant. Looking back, I feel this was a missed opportunity to enjoy time with my group and connect. Since the program, I have learned to speak up when meeting new people and initialize a conversion, and from this lesson, I have made friends in classes I am now taking at Mason.","I feel intimidated as a woman in computer science. I would be grateful to participate in the Sprinternship as it would provide me a supportive opportunity to start my career in the technology field. I do not want to change my major, but I often think of the various work environments I will face. I want to be a change and explore the technology industry with women I meet along my way. For this reason, I would love to be a participant in the Break Through Tech Sprinternship program because it has a mission to foster a safe and inclusive community for women like me in the technology industry.

In terms of professional goals, the Sprinternship would give me my first technology internship with a company. With the experience, I will be able to narrow my choices toward a career that best matches my strengths, so I can channel my energy in making the world a better place. I would be very grateful to work with a company that hires paid interns so students can gain early experience in their careers. My ultimate goal will be to try my best in meeting the company's needs, establishing positive connections with the people I meet, and learning from the experience.","I participated in the Summer Guild program at Mason this past summer and loved the learning environment. I felt that I was less self-conscious and was able to focus on what I was learning. Since my first year at Mason was online, I wasn't aware of how distinct the gender gap was and was extremely surprised when I started classes in person this semester. Even my math classes, which are currently discrete and calc3, had a small percentage of women. I realize that this will likely be my working environment later on, but I would love to learn in a comfortable environment through the Sprinternship that has a mission to create an inclusive community of women in tech. Through this opportunity, I will be able to dedicate my energy towards learning and being the best employee I can be, instead of facing possible mansplaining and harassment.

One of the solutions gathered from the team was to host the event across virtual platforms so people can attend the event during the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference organizing group assembled into different groups according to what we believe we are represented of. We were able to target certain groups and oversee the groups that we represented the most. By working together, tackling problems, and finding solutions; made us succeed. As a result, we were able to reach out and receive more than 400+ students, faculty, and professional attendees across the United States for our Cloud Computing Conference despite the COVID-19 Lockdown. These diverse teams are the best because having different perspectives from people always could stir the team in the right direction with decreased biases and attract the targeted audience from different backgrounds.","I believe that participating in this program would provide me with great resources that I can utilize throughout my CS career.

During the last decade, the places to acquire those elements have changed. I saw the clothing industry shifting its primary revenue source from offline stores to e-commerce. The food industry with the delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Doordash is growing rapidly and taking the market share aggressively. Even for a house, platforms like Zillow stepped into the e-commerce for people who live from a distance to freely explore listed houses through their phones at home. As more I learned about those changes, I became more interested in learning technology that allowed these changes to occur. These transitions made me explore how technology affects my daily life and my near future, and I would like to participate in those transitions by working in the technology industry.

I am excited by a career in tech because it will give me the power to create positive change in the world. My dream is to make the field of Computer Science accessible to underprivileged and unrepresented groups through my career. In this day and age, coding is undeniably an unparalleled skill to have. Not only has it transformed the world, but it can open doors to innumerable career opportunities. However, the problem is that not everyone has equal access to learn how to code. I recognize that I am in a position of privilege as someone who has always had access to a computer and learning resources. In the future, my dream is to work as a software developer. I want to create software that will help bridge the educational gap between underprivileged and privileged groups in Computer Science.","A few years back, I was in a government class. We were given a group project for a mock election. One person in our group was to be the candidate, and the rest of us were his supporters; our job was to help him prepare for the election day, on which he would be the one to present his party’s stances. However, on the day of the election, our candidate was absent! None of us, including myself, were prepared to present unexpectedly.

This was an inconvenient situation for all of us, so I decided to be a team player. Even though it was not originally my job, I volunteered to do the presentation. This was a difficult decision for me because I lacked confidence. Government has never been my strong suit and neither has public speaking. I truly believed that I wasn’t the most suitable person for this role. However, even though I didn’t feel good, I made this decision for the rest of my team. All of them were clearly in the same boat as me, and so I put my feelings aside and prioritized the betterment of my group.

Contrary to what I had anticipated, I was actually able to give a successful presentation of our party’s stances. However, in the future, I learned to be extra prepared in group projects. That day, I went into class assuming our candidate would be present. Our group didn’t prepare an alternative plan. Although we ended up managing, it certainly would have been easier if we had a backup plan to begin with.
","I want to participate in the Sprinternship program because I am passionate about Computer Science and considering my aspirations in life, I think I am the ideal candidate for this opportunity.

My goal for participating in the Sprinternship program is to increase my expertise in Computer Science. Specifically, I would like to gain skills that will help me pursue my long-term goal of helping underprivileged and underrepresented groups. This includes both technical and interpersonal skills. Most of my experience coding has been in college classes. I would like to learn more efficient ways to problem solve while coding in a work environment. Thus far, a vast majority of my class assignments have been individual work. I would like to increase my experience working with others. Not only would I like to learn how to be a better programmer, but I would also like to learn how to be a more effective communicator and increase my social intelligence.
","I am a huge supporter of the Sprinternship program’s cause. As a woman in STEM, I myself have felt marginalized. I’ve even been told not to pursue this path because “it’s for boys”. People argue that men and women have equal opportunities; however, they largely overlook how discouraging it can be for young girls to pursue STEM when they don’t have any female role models to look up to, and when they are told that STEM is “for boys”. In the future, I look forward to becoming a female role model for young girls who are interested in computer science or other STEM fields. 

I want to learn in this environment and community because not only will it increase my experience in computer science, but it will give me the skills that will help me pave the way for others who are part of underrepresented groups.

In 1936, Alan Turing created the Turing Machine. And today, in 2021, we have transcended from theoretical discussions of computing software to virtual reality, machine learning, data mining, and programming. 

Every previous generation of ideas fuels the future canvas of innovation.

When I look at the exponential pace of technology growing, I can only wish to be a part of that expansion. Particularly, I hope to learn more about AI and machine learning, robotics, and even more info about programming languages' role in machine learning. As impressive robotic models grow like Sophia or the hotel in Japan run by robots, I want to be able to make these robots and learn more about machine learning and its ethics. 

Even with pressing global problems like poverty, inequality, climate change, and mental health, I believe tech can help fix those problems. Right now, technology is cheaper than ever, and in the future it will be even cheaper as more research and advancements are made. To see current robots clean sewers in India and AI in healthcare fills me with excitement when I imagine the uses and applications of these technologies in the future. I want to see these robots working with doctors, firefighters, and teachers to help their purpose. I truly believe that a career in technology can help the most vulnerable people. The ability to improve lives and make an actual difference in the world is what excited me the most about a job in computer science.","Last year, I was assigned to work in a team with 3 other students to create messaging about the COVID-19 vaccine pandemic using rhetorical devices for HNRS261. The goal of the team was to create a product that could reach 3 different audiences: people who are unsure about the vaccine but want to get it, people who know they want to get the vaccine but don't know how, and people who are very skeptical of the vaccine. Our team created 4 posters, with at least 1 poster for each target group and 1 meme related to each poster so that it could be posted on social media by the Student Health Services team if they wished to do so.

Although we didn't have a designated leader, I designated and made sure the group was on task. For example, I set up virtual meetings on our coordinated meeting times,. When we had to submit discussion questions or assignments, I helped transcribed, reviewed, and submitted our work. In terms of deliverables, I created the memes and 2 of the posters, whilst presenting the team drafts to the class. One of the assignments was to take an interview with our focus group, where I acted as one of the transcribers. I tried my best to support the group when they needed help, such as helping one of my teammates find contact avenues within GMU clubs to spread our project materials. My role can best be described as the implementer and coordinator. My strength is turning our ideas into actual products. 

Given the feedback that we received from our teacher, I would try to look at the design aspects of the materials, such as choosing a solid color scheme across our posters, and fine tune our posters to reach a more specific target audience, perhaps specifically for Mason. Normally, I am more content-focused, which is one of the reasons why I love coding because it is logical and driven by input. However, focusing on the user-perspective with design elements and improving the connection to the target audience would be beneficial because it makes the products more effective and eye-catching.","Personal - I want to be able to connect to the companies and team mates. I am usually introverted, but I want to take this opportunity to put myself out there. I also want to make more connections to the other sprinternship participants and companies.

Academic - I simply want to learn more about how the content I am learning will be used in the real world. Sometimes, our coding exercises for CS211 can be used to create actual apps, but it can also be isolated to the class. I want to see what programming languages are trendy in actual jobs or what skillsets they are looking for in the real world, such as knowledge with SQL or AWS. I only know a bit about Python and Java, and I have recently started CS330 and CS262, so I am still vastly unfamiliar with the world of CS. 

Professional - If I get accepted, this will be my first internship. I want to learn more about the different industries CS can offer. I've heard that CS is useful in any field. I've heard terms like ""full-stack developer,"" ""front-end developer,"" ""back-end developer,"" and ""security analyst"" being used, so I want to learn more about what each role in an individual company entails and which would best fit me and my career goals.","I am taking virtual classes for computer science.

Breakthrough Tech allowed me to meet people with similar stories or interests, and that is motivating on its own. I have a group of people who I can talk to and see how they are doing with their own projects.

Breakthrough Tech is also less stressful than traditional avenues of getting internships or meeting people. I've always been doubtful of whether I'm the right fit for an internship, and I've had to stop myself from applying to other internships simply because my skill level does not encompass the requirements they are asking for.

Technology is everywhere and is very important in our lives. For example, it is used in business, biology, and healthcare to do various things. A tech career would allow me to create technology and software for society to do things, quicker, and easier. For example, I can help advance education for students by creating and improving applications in devices to make learning easier and faster. Also, I would use my computer science career to reduce global problems like climate change. Climate change is a big issue that our world has been facing since the 19th century. With computer science, I can develop better and cheaper technology that can help reduce our carbon footprint. Many problems that we are facing can be solved with computer science, and I hope that with a tech career I can help solve some of them. Also what excites me is to code a lot for my career. By coding, I can make applications, games, or websites that people can use and interact with. Coding is interesting to me because I love solving problems logically. 
","     When I was in tenth grade, I led a science fair team. The goal of the team was to successfully complete an experiment and showcase it in front of judges. We tested the effect of the amount of nitrogen, in the form of fertilizer, on the formation of nodules on chickpeas. I scheduled meetings and the experiment setup. I also volunteered to be in charge of the daily measuring and recording of nodules for the experiment and assigned roles to the other group members based on their writing and creative skills. Finally, I followed up with group members when they fell behind on their tasks and reported the data for each plant with my group every other week. We each did our tasks and brought them all together to make a successful project to showcase after working on it for months. What I would do differently next time is be more organized and write down a list of all the goals that we should accomplish every week for this experiment. This would allow us to achieve our goals faster and more efficiently.

The world is becoming increasingly digitized, which means that the onset of cyber crime is on the rise. Domestically and federally, information is simply no longer safe in the virtual domain. This means that data, ranging all the way from common, user-end information to sensitive, government details face a constant threat of being hacked. With the goal of becoming a cybersecurity analyst, my hope is that my work in college and beyond will contribute to a safer digital environment. My ultimate ambition is to work for the federal government under the DoD to help protect America's online platforms. As such, as career in tech is an opportunity for me to step into the shows of current 21st century cyber leaders and face next-gen challenges. ","During my Cyber Security Externship with Experience., my team and I participated in a Cyber Patriot system hardening challenge. Before the challenge, I divided our team into small groups so we could each tackle a different component of the challenge. While one group was working on auditing, for example, the other was working on finding leftover vulnerabilities or clues to patch up additional security weaknesses within the system. With this tactic in place, my team was able to divide and conquer, and secure our path to victory. By dividing the team up by individual strengths, we were able to concentrate our efforts in areas what most suited each of our skillsets. As such, my role on the team was to act as the leading team coordinator and organizer. One challenge we faced during our challenge was communicating through each of our group tasks (we would get so wrapped up in our own tasks, that we would forget to communicate them to the rest of the team). One way to fix this issue in the future is to establish team check-ins times. During these check-ins periods, we could have communicated more smoothly and made sure everyone was updated with the other groups.

I am also interested in the intersection between AI and fashion design. I think tech is interesting because there are no limits to what you can do. The only constraints are your mind! It's a field for analytical minds, but it provides a lot of space for creatives to be involved as well. And lucky for me, I am both! Another thing that excites me about a career in tech is the opportunity to serve as a role model. I am an African American Muslim woman and I would love the opportunity to inspire other young girls who are just like me. In general, I would like to serve as a role model and an inspiration for all women who want to pursue a tech career. I want to break ceilings and push boundaries to their limits.

","The most recent time I worked well with a team was this past weekend at the GMU Honors College Connect Nonprofit Hackathon. about 30 of us were randomly placed into 4 teams of 5/6, and assigned a nonprofit organization to help rebrand or improve their communications. My team was assigned to work with the Starfish Foundation, an organization that provides scholarship, tutoring, and leadership development to youth living in extreme poverty in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The goal of our team was to strategically use existing or new content to tell a story reflecting the Starfish Foundation's impactful services and inspire potential supporters to be a part of their mission. I contributed ideas on content that could be created, my thoughts on how we could use existing content, and ways to engage potential volunteers or supporters. My role was to help come up with prototypes of all the ideas we came up with and to collaborate with my partners to present our final ideas to Jenn, the nonprofit owner. Some of the ideas we came up with included an interactive donation tracker/portal for donors and volunteers, a ""Walk of Change"" page on their website, scripted videos, montages of the children, social media posting schedules, physical marketing, and general advertising. Although this was a positive experience, and I worked well with my team, I would do a few things differently next time. I have a tendency to let people talk over me, and I am working on stopping that. Next time, I will make sure my voice and my ideas are clearly heard. I believe this internship would be a great opportunity to improve on that.","Participating in the Sprintenship program would be a meaningful experience because I love women in STEM, and I am excited about more girls and underrepresented genders getting involved in the field. I am a computer science major with a prospective minor in math. So far, my computer science class has been amazing, and I have met a lot of great people, but you know who I haven't met a lot of? Women. I did meet many impressive young men, but I couldn’t help but feel a little lost being one of the few girls there. I am aware of the general lack of women in STEM, and I want to help raise those numbers. I know there are many other intelligent women in the STEM field, and I want to find them.

We collaborate effectively through group messaging apps and contributed code through GitHub so that we could work asynchronously in response to the pandemic. I worked primarily on the graphical user interface for the music editor, and once my teammates had created the necessary tools to play notes, I integrated that functionality into the music sheet in the GUI. I also coordinated expectations and deadlines for my other teammates as I was reliant on their completion of certain aspects of the backend to effectively work with the GUI. 

Although I believe the project went well overall, I believe I should have used JavaFX to explore more unfamiliar territory and provide a cleaner GUI. I stuck to Java Swing because I feared time constraints and was somewhat more familiar with Swing. I believe creating a long-term timeline would have helped resolve my fears. I also believe having group meetings, while not necessary, would have potentially expedited or innovated our work by having us be in an environment where we could bounce ideas of off one another which is not as effective a strategy with asynchronous communication and programming.","I currently lack real world experience in the tech industry and wish to obtain that experience through the Sprinternship program.

There would be different graph expressions on cards and participants had to solve to find whether the expression is a function or not and its output. After writing down the answers, the participants will insert the card and the machine will output the right answer immediately.

At first, it was the excitement of building robots and making them move as I desired. This curiosity pushed me to continue pursuing STEM classes in middle school and high school. My high school experience was the most defining in broadening my view on STEM, eventually leading to me deciding to major in Cyber Security Engineering. I realized I had a lot of interests outside of STEM such as environmental sustainability, business, law and policy. I wanted to major in an area of STEM that allows for flexibility to pursue my different interests. Like computer science, cyber security allows me to apply my cyber knowledge to a variety of industries as the protection of our systems becomes more important each day. Mason’s unique focus on the engineering aspect of cyber security was even more appealing because of my curiosity about how things work. Having the opportunity to get involved with companies that have similar interests as me and contributing by strengthening their systems so that they can focus on accomplishing the broader goals truly motivates me. ","Recently, I worked with two local companies called Bixal and CodeNinajs to host a collaborative networking event for the members of George Mason University’s Girls Who Code (GWC) College Loop, an organization where I currently serve as vice president. I had the amazing opportunity to work with professionals from a variety of tech fields who also had the goal of providing more support to women entering the STEM field. Our goal as a team was to create an event in which members can get advice about their respective majors and career paths from other women who have been in their place. We did this by creating an event in which attendees can join different groups to interact with an expert in their field and ask any questions they might have. 
I was the main point of contact for Girls Who Code and focused on developing an event that students would be interested in based on my experiences. I reached out to the Society of Women Engineers to increase the scope of our event and reach more girls. I actively attended planning meetings, contributed a variety of ideas for the event itself, and maintained an open line of communication between GWC, Bixal, CodeNinjas, and the Society of Women Engineers. I was also involved with delegating tasks to GWC officers when it came to promoting the event. 
While I learned an immense amount about what goes into organizing and hosting a successful event, some skills I would personally like to work on is engaging more GWC officers- not only to share the hands-on experience with others but to also distribute the work more evenly. Additionally, I wish I was a bit more proactive in organizing some aspects of the event such as RSVP forms because I felt that it was rushed. This opportunity was an amazing learning experience for me and I loved getting to interact with a diverse group of individuals.","I would love the opportunity to participate in this Sprinternship to better prepare myself for entering a career in cyber security. A program like this allows me to focus on my personal goals of emotional independence and financial independence by allowing me to connect with other female-identifying students and gain more insight on how to do well in a field that tends to be dominated by males. I believe building a supportive community for females is extremely important, which is what I’m trying to do as a part of Girls Who Code. I would like to explore this further through this Sprinternship as I also focus on my academic goal to continue learning things that I’m passionate about. Learning to me goes beyond simply learning concepts on my own. I believe the exchange of ideas between individuals is an essential part of learning and the Sprintership program will allow me to share my experiences while hearing from others who have unique backgrounds. Lastly, I would like to improve my professional skills and one of the best ways to do this is through career development, which this program emphasizes. If I’m given this opportunity, I would not only focus on expanding my professional network, but I would also seek to get professional advice and suggestions on things such as resumes and interview skills. ","As a junior, I’m looking for opportunities that will allow me to move closer to my academic, professional, and personal goals. Because of that, this program’s focus on creating a safe and inclusive environment in which I can work towards these goals excited me. Additionally, I love engaging with people from different backgrounds. One of my favorite things about Mason is that I have had the opportunity to work with people who have unique experiences. After working on a project in my Art and Protest class in which I got to work with people of different majors, I realized diversity is something I would love to have in my career and the programs I get involved with. Although attendees of this Sprinternship are pursuing a career in tech, the chance of working closely with and meeting like-minded, yet diverse females excites me.",Yes,"Herndon, VA","Washington, DC,Virginia - Arlington and Fairfax Counties","I understand the time commitment of participating in a Sprinternship.

By doing so I would not only be able to help the greater community but assist others in my field at completing their objectives and benefitting society as well. Specific areas of interest for me would be cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and ethics and compliance in programming and data collection and usage.","An event that describes when I have worked well in a team would have to be when I am working during my shift every Thursday and Friday. Working at a boba shop, there is usually a rush that requires me and my coworkers to quickly make and hand out the drinks. To make sure the drinks are made in a timely manner we usually split up our roles and pass the drinks down the line. My role was to add the correct toppings to each drink and hand it to my coworker who would put ice in the cup and fill it with the selected drink. Though this may seem like a simple display of teamwork if anywhere in this chain me or my coworker's messed up, we would have to remake the drink which would mess up the flow and have customers wait longer for their drink.","My personal, academic, and professional goals for the Sprinternship program are to expand my professional network while learning and gaining valuable work experience in my field of study (computer science). Having little to no work/internship experience in my field of study, I believe the Sprinternship program would be an excellent opportunity to put what I have learned and my skills to the test and figure out where I excel and areas I need to improve on. At the same time, I would also be able to receive input from people who have experience in the field and could teach me much more than I already learn in my classes. The opportunity to meet other people who are interested in tech and people who work in tech is also a major reason why I applied as meeting new people can help me learn new things and build long-lasting relationships.","In learning to become a programmer an important skill to have is to be mindful of one's own biases and being open-minded to new ideas. By learning in the environment and community fostered by the Sprinternship program I would be able to meet many different people with their own unique backgrounds and stories. The reason I would want to learn in this sort of community is because of the vast amount of different perspectives that could challenge my own and help me grow not only as a programmer but as a person.

Going into high school, though, it became hard for me to stick to a profession I wanted to pursue, and I constantly switched between one interest to another every year, until I found out about Computer Science. The one aspect I knew for sure I wanted in a future career was the ability to get hands-on experience and to be able to contribute directly to an end product. With computer science, I felt as though I would get the best of both worlds: projects can be created using the different coding languages learned, research could be conducted in an area of interest. I would have the skills to be able to build machines and programs and see how my work accumulates to an end result. Best of all, computer science can be combined with many fields: learning Python could lead to a career in AI and Machine Learning which can be used to create algorithms to monitor environmental health and curb global warming, one of my other main interests. The ability to build things and be creative about how to approach a problem with my programming and technology skills while pursuing a career in any field of my choice is what excites me about a career in this field. ","During the winter of 2020, I participated in an internship for a company that was developing a beta app for paying housekeeping in hotels. As part of the graphic design team for the project, I had to work with other individuals to come up with interfaces for the app. We were a highly collaborative team and the nature of a lot of our work was dependent on the work of other members as well. This experience helped develop my communication, project management and leadership skills, as at times I was part of projects that involved two people collaborating to create a shared end product. During these times, I had to make sure I was on top of my share of work and that I effectively communicated any issues to the others in the project. I also actively participated in scrum meetings, taking up work, giving other members’ insights, and actively seeking feedback on my products.  I was even allowed to lead a portion of the project, which involved keeping track of the other members’ progresses. This aspect of the internship, being in constant contact with the other members to work together as a unit, created a sense of community and made it easier to work on the project. ","Since I am a freshman in college, it has been difficult to find opportunities to put my skills in a real-world setting. Attending career fairs, so far I've seen most employers for internships and jobs take only Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. This opportunity would allow me to get that real-world experience, but in a more comfortable setting where other internship applicants are also from within the same community.  Because I  haven’t participated in a Computer Science and IT related internship as of yet, it would be a great learning experience for me that would allow me to test the waters with the guidance of from Break Through Tech and GMU and the skills I learn can be used to built onto for my future internships and jobs. ","The Sprinternship is for college students and women in computing, which means many of the applicants would be coming from a similar background to mine. Knowing this makes me more comfortable with the setting, as I feel as though the shared background would aid in building a stronger sense of community. For my first real-world experience in my planned major, the feeling of intimidation that comes with being in a more serious setting than a classroom would be offset by the sense of community and guidance the experience would foster. I believe the Sprinternship would allow me to explore while giving me assurance that there are people I can easily turn to if help is needed.

With a career in tech, you are constantly working on new projects, learning about new concepts and ideas, and consistently growing and strengthening your skills. This is was interests and excites me most about a career in tech. There are so many different job opportunities and ways to apply yourself and you will truly never be bored of your job. Furthermore there is a constant reliance on technology throughout the world that will continue to grow throughout our future. This entails that there are numerous different job opportunities when pursuing a career in tech. You can go from working as a database administrator for the State Department, to working in a cybersecurity role for Coco Chanel, and even to being a software developer for Facebook and Instagram.  Additionally, due to the high demand for technology, a  career in tech allows you to meet and collaborate with people all across the globe and discover new parts of the world because of your job. Finally, the major aspect that truly excites me about a career in tech is the ability to utilize your work to help shape and change the world for the better. Technology is such a crucial part of human life and directly correlates with the way we live our lives. The first iPhone came out about twenty years ago, and this single piece of technology changed our lives forever. Through this creation, we have apps, programs, and systems that we never could have imagined before. Technology allows you to communicate with people throughout the world, buy anything imaginable on the internet, and constantly entertain yourself, just with a click of your fingertips. Having a career in tech truly allows you to discover new experiences, create new innovations, and ultimately create a positive impact within society and the world. ","A key time I worked well on a team was at my previous workplace, CakeTime, in my  position as Team Leader. Essentially, CakeTime is a diy decorating studio where customers could come in to decorate already prepared cakes and cupcakes. Our job was to prepare everything and have it ready, so when customers came in they could get straight to decorating. Through the service policy at CakeTime, customers could book reservations an hour or earlier in advance. At the time, I was managing the store, and had two other employees with me. We had just finished getting all of the orders ready for the next session time slot, and moved on to inventory. However, when the customers started coming in, a new group appeared saying they had made a reservation. None of us had refreshed the online schedule so the order was completely not ready. We had no cakes crumb coated, no fondated cakes ready, and no trays with instructions. Initially, I panicked but I quickly came up with a plan as we needed to get the order ready as fast as possible in order to please the customers. I quickly assigned one of the other employees with crumb coating the cakes, which essentially means frosting and putting together two layers of cake so they are ready to be covered with fondant. Once they were done, I would take over and fondant the cakes in order to give them to the customers. I then tasked the other employee with printing the cake instructions and assembling the trays. In the mean time, I set up the customers by helping them follow COVID policies to start decorating and helped them look throughout the stores at the various cakes on display. Although I seemed at ease, on the inside I was super nervous as both of the employees were fairly new and did not yet understand the fast paced hustle necessary for these situations. While they were a bit slow, thankfully once the trays were ready, the customers were able to settle down and start decorating some of the details they would be adding to their cakes. Also, once one of the cakes was frosted correctly, I quickly fondanted it and served it so the customers could at least start working on one of the cakes. In the next fifteen minutes, the second cake was out, and we ensured the customers they could take longer time if necessary due to the mix up. Thankfully, they were extremely appreciative and kind and didn't mind the mistake at all. However, as we were helping get these customers settled in, other customers were coming in and there was no one there to properly greet them and settle them in as we were all busy. So once, we were done with the specific set of customers, all of us were rushing around trying to get the rest of the customers settled. While everything successfully worked out in the end, it ended up causing all of us lots of stress especially for me because my boss was counting on me to run the store properly and ensure all customers were satisfied. 
The goal of the team was to get the cakes out as fast as possible for the unexpected order because we had not prepared beforehand. As team leader, I contributed by delegating roles to the other employees, while also taking care of the customers and managing the store. Some things I would have done differently is check the schedule multiple times and refresh the page and switch roles with the employee crumb coating the cakes. I would have been a bit faster but in my mind I chose to help the customers because the new employees did not know all of the customer protocols yet. However, if I had crumb coated the orders would have been done much faster. ","There are numerous reasons as to why I would love to participate in the Sprinternship Program. Primarily, as a beginner in the computer science field, I am truly looking to gain hands on experience and learn more about careers in computer science. There are so many different job aspects to choose from in the computer science field, and I really want to find my specific calling within the field. Additionally, this is an amazing opportunity as most internship programs are looking for people with experience and are not giving opportunities to beginners. This program can truly launch my career within computer science because it will allow me to develop my skills and learn how to work within a typical stem workspace. 
Additionally, I truly want to participate in the Sprinternship program because of its goals to help increase the number of women pursuing degrees in computer science. As a women in stem, I truly see the gap between men and women within computer science and I can see the prejudice and stereotypes that women constantly face within this field. While I am only within my freshman year of college, I have already seen many examples of prejudice against me as a woman by my male counterparts. Working in such an inclusive program can make me feel welcomed within the computer science field and can help me understand how I should really be treated within the department. Furthermore, I want to help change the narrative and stigma against women in computer science. It has been very difficult to find higher level women within the computer science department at George Mason, which truly made me realize how underrepresented women are within the field. Through this program, I can find many other women within the field and create new connections with them so we can all relate to one another. Furthermore, these connections could truly help me create friendships that could benefit me in the long run. Overall, I feel that the Sprinternship program will be an incredible opportunity that will help me start building my career as a computer science major. ","The Sprinternship environment and community sounds very inclusive and willing to give new opportunities to beginners in the computer science field. These are key features I am interested in within my internship because it shows how the Sprinternship program care about their interns and want to truly help them. Furthermore, the Sprinternship community is very open and including which indicates that it will be a great safe space, especially because it is for women within the computer science field. This will allow me to be part of a community that is willing to help me and fight against the stereotypes I will face as a women in stem. Additionally, the goals of the sprinternship program are ones that I value because in a society where women are underrepresented within stem, keeping alliances with companies that support you and your achievements. I feel that this program will allow me to connect with the company I would work for while also building connections with the other women within my program. These connections are ones that will last a lifetime and can truly help you in the long run when looking for job opportunities.",Yes,"Aldie,Virginia ","Virginia - Arlington and Fairfax Counties,Virginia - Loudon and Faquier Counties","I understand the time commitment of participating in a Sprinternship.

Not only to be incredibly privileged enough to grow up being immersed in technology and engineering starting at such a young age, but to also derive so much genuine happiness from it. There are many people out there who don’t know what they want to do with their life but for me it was never a question. I love programming. That’s not to say it has been all rainbows and butterflies all the time as I’ve had probably one too many 3am breakdowns over broken code (What do you mean my memory is leaking? Just duct tape it!). But, if I’m being honest, it only makes when I finally finish that much more satisfying. I know it’s not one of the noblest of intentions to want to have a career in tech like trying to make a difference in the community or to create something to better the world, but all I know is that when I’m programming it makes me happy and when I haven’t in a while I crave it and when I’m frustrated I rather be frustrated with code than with anything else. While I don't know what exact job position I want just yet, I know I want to program for the rest of my life. ","While I hope that I’ve worked well on every team I’ve been on, a major team project I’ve been on recently was my last semester's final project for my game design class. We had to design and create a game on a website called Construct 3. What my team and I decided on was to do a pseudo 3D shooter where our protagonist had to defeat a giant mutant bunny by shooting it and jumping to different platforms that circled around the enemy. The reason I say it’s pseudo 3D is because Construct 3 does not support any 3D rendering in any capacity but we got around that by drawing frame by frame at different angles to simulate 3D movement. When the player or protagonist moved, the frame would change as if the scene was rotating and there are frames where it would look as if an enemy was attacking. My role in the project was being the programmer. We had an artist, an audio tech, and a documenter/PR person and my job was to put together the art and music and create a functional game. It was grueling as Construct 3 only allows 50 free lines of code without purchasing their premium service and the way around that I found was by putting multiple lines of code on the same line (a syntactical nightmare) but about 350 frames and many all nighters later the final product is something I’m genuinely proud of. You can really tell how much effort and love everyone on my team put into this game. And while I know this isn’t directly Computer Science related, it was a challenge that put me out of my element and made me struggle in ways I haven’t before. If I had a chance to redo the project, I would not have waited for finished frames to begin incorporating their associated code and would have used placeholder frames instead of waiting.","As much as I have a passion for programming, that passion can only take me so far.

There were various elements to building the app like finding a data set, which we can use to create an AI model, conducting user research, and writing code. My role was to conduct user research to find gaps in why certain age groups were struggling to recycle, and how our app can bridge those gaps.

We each divided our roles and the steps of the lab we took charge of. I would set up the experiment and describe results to my partner who would time and record notes. We would analyze the results and share our findings with our other two members. Sharing our results with each other helped us make sure we made as few mistakes as possible. We worked efficiently each lab and passed the semester with flying colors.

If I were to do change anything with my experience with my team, I would have tried to act differently under pressure. Since we had time constraints with each lab, it was easy to feel stressed just by looking at the number of steps to complete. I would end up rushing at times and because of this, I would report incorrect measurements or even skip some important steps.

Technology is very relevant in our everyday lives and is integrated with practically every career in today’s world; although people in other professions learn to use technology for their work, I want to work on behind the scenes of engineering and improve the existing technology. Also, this field is constantly evolving so learning doesn’t stop after obtaining a degree and I believe that's what interests me the most because I will always be learning new things. As a kid, I enjoyed being creative to find multiple ways to solve a puzzle, and having a career in tech is similar because there isn’t only one way to approach a problem. ","I believe the best activity that describes my role in a team is my Science Fair project in high school because the project was long-term and therefore tests some of the skills that a team member must have to succeed. The goal of my team was to present an experimental design that displays the effect of caffeine on daphnia’s heart rate to show the consequences of caffeine on organisms. One of the things that we did successfully was that each team member was a leader at some point of the project based on their skills and this is important in a team because letting the expert lead the others allows the team to be more efficient and head into the right direction of their project. In my team, I was in a leadership role for organizing the content that we had to present, researching, and conducting the experiment itself. I did this project with my friends so we were not being productive all the time; something I would do differently next time is to strictly focus on work when it is time to do so and set some of the boundaries even though I am familiar with them so the productivity and time usage is maximized.

I want to learn some of the skills that are needed to be successful in a career such as communication, collaboration, and self-management. I think that this Sprinternship is a great way to learn these skills while having fun as I work with other people that are also coming from underrepresented groups. Professionally, I hope doing this Sprinternship will open more opportunities for me such as summer internships or part-time jobs to start my career in technology.

What interests me the most is discovering and learning the process and mechanisms behind how technology works. For instance, if I am playing a game or using an application on my phone, I am always curious as to how they designed it. I think about the different kinds of codes they might have had to write in order to make the program work. One of the main reasons a tech career interests me is because I know that I will never get bored of performing the same task over and over because of the fast-paced development of technology which creates more opportunities for learning and innovation. I truly believe that the field of tech is like a pandora box- the deeper we dig, the more we learn. The wide range of opportunities in tech is another factor that fascinates me. Regardless of one's intelligence (be it too much or not too much), I believe that as long as one has the drive and passion towards pursuing something of their interests, they will always discover a tech career suited for them, and also find a way to excel in it.","I personally do not think I am a trouble-maker when it comes to teamwork. I always have my responsibilities set straight and performed all the assigned tasks. I try to lead the team if I can. One time in eleventh grade, I was assigned a group project in my business management class in the beginning of the year. Since this was during the first few weeks of school, no one in the class knew each other, and I just had to form a group with a random bunch of people. Most people in the group were very introverted, and hesitated to make any significant contributions to the group discussion on the first day. I was afraid that if we would not make any progression if we continued this behavior. Although our team had no 'leader' per se, I took it upon myself to take responsibility to get done with the project on time. The next I walked into the class and went back to my group, I tried to initiate conversations unrelated to the project in order to make them feel comfortable around each other. We talked about our favorite shows, songs, artists, our classes and teachers and just life in general which really helped to get to know each other, and work on the project. This made the project a lot smoother, and we working on it as a group, helping out each other if one of us was stuck on any part. There were disagreements on certain aspects as a project, but then again, we came together as a group and we took majority votes and went with the ideas and opinions that everyone agreed with. I was very proud of how the project turned out, and we scored an A. I was glad that I took the initiative to bring everyone together and work together as a group.","As a freshman in college, I think it is essential to gain experience working and learning in a larger setting, working with people from different backgrounds. I also think that women are highly underrepresented in tech fields, and programs such as this will help bridge the gap. Growing up taking stem related courses, one thing I noticed was that there were more guys than girls. I often wondered why this was, even though the first ever programmer was actually a woman. I have heard a lot of girls say that stem related activities such as coding is hard, which is why they often sway away from it, but I believe it is because of lack of opportunities available exclusively for women and other minorities. I believe that programs such as sprinternship, focused to encourage more women pursue careers in computer science and careers in tech are necessary in order to battle this stereotype revolving around technology and women. I want to participate in the sprinternship program to gain valuable experience and skills in computer science related activities, develop a professional network, and to meet other fellow women in STEM.","I want to learn how people solve problems in real world, and I also want to get exposed to working in larger groups, and develop skills that will help me when I work a professional job in the future. I would also like to meet professionals and develop networks for future purposes. Most importantly, I think I would be very comfortable working in this environment since it is just women, and women understand other women's struggles better than anyone else.

The need for analytical thinking in a career in technology, as opposed to mechanical labor in many other industries, is fascinating.  As a vivid thinker, the creativity and intellect required to solve complex problems in society through unconventional technology, interests and encourages me to explore more about technology’s potential in the real world, particularly in healthcare and business. The rapid advancements and radical innovations made in the field of technology–whether it is the use of sensors and wearable devices to monitor key health metrics , or the development of a touch screen from the traditional keypad – have greatly motivated me to pursue a major in computer science that will enable me to amplify my success and contribution to society.","During my senior year of high school, I participated in a STEM workshop with my fellow coders in a programming club. As a part of the workshop, we were to invite students from nearby elementary and middle schools to teach them basic coding techniques in Python. I was one of the ‘mentors’ in the team and my responsibility was to expand on the basics, teach and present a real-world example that the students will analyze to construct a code in Python. As a team, our goal was to teach students about computer science and its importance/uses in the real world. Consequently, while the rest of the team instructed about technology and computer programming, I worked on explaining the real-world applications of technology–its uses in the healthcare industry for communication between doctors and patients, in the agricultural industry to enhance the growth and survival of plants, etc. This was an especially rewarding experience because I was able to observe the various approaches students took to understand and arrive at an answer for the problems presented. The next time I am involved in such a team and activity, I would most-likely explain about components in technology other than programming such as computer hardware and internet access. ","As a first-year student, I would consider myself privileged to gain quality experience and knowledge about the workplace–its benefits, its culture and its importance. With the Sprinternship program, however, I believe that in addition to learning about technology, I will be more considerate and aware of team work. Working with a team with similar education and skills in this program, but with diverse capabilities and cultures, will make me feel inclusive and professional, and will allow me to perform better in the workplace.  Beginning my journey for a career in technology through the Sprinternship program will mentor me to be independent. Working in a professional setting will allow me to learn, understand, analyze and solve problems actively by myself and with my peers, encouraging me to be intellectually autonomous. Finally, being independent of my surroundings and learning individually will make me empowered and attentive of my skills and my newly gained cherished experience. ","I believe that in order to be successful in a workplace, communication and social skills are vital, and interacting in this community will allow me to improve those skills including actively listening to my peers and clearly communicating my ideas with everyone. Learning with peers in this environment will also be uplifting and inspiring. Since every student is on the same path and exploring new ideas and solutions with each other everyday, it is motivating to look at problems and challenges from diverse students perspectives, and analyze them differently than usual. As a freshman pursuing a college career in college, the Sprinternship will give me the opportunity to be recognized by other employers and educators for the skills and knowledge I have displayed and earned from training in the program. I am eager to work in this community to build cherished and memorable relationships with my peers and my mentors.

Teams were randomly selected by the professor and the team was made up by a women, a guy, and myself. At first there was very little communication between us, nobody knew how to approach each other so we all started working individually on the code. After a couple of days I decided to ask about each members experience and what part of the project they believed to be able to do. The guy was coding since high school and he was the one with the most experience, the lady was an older woman who decided to start a new career in tech and was fairly new to programming, and I was just beginning to learn how to code. We divided our task and after classes w met up with each other to go over the code and help one another. At the end we achieved to be successful and learned a lot along the way since it didn't matter who had more experience, at times another team member had a better and more efficient idea but didn't know how to translate it to code.

Tech is a massive field that is always coming out with new discoveries or questions to answer. As someone who thrives on newness and is always trying to understand the world around me, a career in tech is everything I'm passionate about rolled into one. I want to learn as much as I can from anywhere I can, and as an industry, tech encourages and promotes that kind of curiosity. The idea that every day there are people working together to combine all the knowledge they have into a new design, a new program, a new idea, makes me want to learn as much as I can from the people around me so that one day I can have a seat at that table and create something new. ","At Code Ninjas, I led a team of individuals to run our summer camps and coding classes. The goal of our team was to create a unique and memorable experience for the children we were teaching, to foster a fun learning environment where parents and children both felt that they were getting the value of their time, and to teach and understand the content we were offering. I was the lead sensei, which meant that I was a face for the parents to turn to when they needed customer service and clarifications of service. This also meant I was the lead of teaching, so I had to thoroughly understand all of the content being taught. In the future, I would delegate the tasks in front of me more evenly so that everyone on the team gained more experience on all fronts. This experience taught me the value of time management and how to concede on some fronts, especially when there were outside stakeholders like customers involved.","To me, the Sprinternship program represents more than an internship, in the same way my future in tech is more than a career. I’m vocally passionate about gender equality and equity in all spaces, especially in tech. I want to gain experience in diverse and accepting spaces that teach me both how to be a stronger individual in my field and to be mindful of the unique experiences and perspectives of those around me. The Sprinternship offers a place where I can grow my tech experience in a fem-centric space. 
","As I mentioned above, I want to grow my tech experience in as many diverse spaces as possible. The experience of knowledge gained in diverse spaces is often more valuable than the information itself. When I participated in the Summer Guild Program, the community showed me that the  camaraderie between women in tech is a key factor to further our scope of opportunity in the field. Meeting other women in tech as mentors and peers gave me a new outlook on the future of diversity in tech and how important it is to create meaningful relationships with each other.

A career within tech would mean spending my time solving real-world problems and being able to address the issues of our time as they arise. The thought of being able to solve a problem that affects our society excites me thoroughly - it is the main driving force behind my decision to go into the tech world. ","I actually work on a team pretty consistently, while at school and at work. A specific time that taught me a great deal would be last semester when I worked on a team to complete a school project. It was quite a difficult experience as the team did not meet in person due to covid-19, which brought many challenges. Nevertheless, I assumed my role as leader of the team and sought to set mini-deadlines not only for myself, but for all my team members. I quickly discovered that due to the lack of meeting in person, it was quite a difficult task to not only follow up with my fellow members; but even to simply agree on a time to meet became near impossible. I quickly grew anxious and frustrated as the deadline loomed closer and closer, and hearing back at all from some members was a rare occurrence. Once I was able to finally get all members to meet, I assed just how behind some were with their portion of the project, and lent some help. I was able to set more mini-deadlines and thanks to this, despite falling behind, my team and I completed our project on time and received an 'A'. After everything was finished, I received many thanks from all members as they agreed that I contributed a lot to achieving our 'A'. One important lesson that I learned from this experience is to not allow my levels of anxiety or frustration to grow if other members do not work at the same pace as I do - as everyone works differently. While it may be difficult to accept at the time, in retrospect, I now know that it will be okay. ","I would love to participate in the Springterhip program as I am eager to obtain my first bit of real-world experience within the tech world. As a DACA student, I have had to go through many hurdles in order to obtain an education. Prior to arriving at Mason this semester, I earned an associate's degree in Computer Science from Northern Virginia Community College, all while working full-time year-round to pay for classes. It was not an easy endeavor, but it was the only way for me to be able to pursue my dream of obtaining a  college education, as federal aid is not an option and even private loans present a sizeable difficulty to DACA students. Given this situation, I was not able to scale back the hours at work until this semester and, as a result, have not been able to focus on obtaining any real-world experience within the tech field. Therefore, taking part in the Springternship program would allow me to take another step into being able to fulfill my dreams. ","I love working with like-minded people. I love the energy that emerges from working with people that share the same passion, goals, and share similar experiences. I believe that surrounding oneself with like-minded people that share similar values and aspirations to be a crucial part of success. I consistently aim to surround myself with such people in my daily life, and always leave energized after spending time with people like this. As a result, I believe that working within this environment would be very beneficial for me and would greatly help me to succeed.

Every single field has a growing demand for tech and the idea that I could pick and chose to work in a field that is in my interest while still working in tech is amazing. Unlike other careers where you are stuck in one field, a career in tech means the flexibility to work in a field where I can apply my knowledge in tech practically anywhere. This also means that if later on I want to move from one field to another I have the necessary skills and knowledge to do so as tech is needed everywhere. The flexibility of working wherever I want also excites me. As many big name tech companies have international offices, the idea that I could theoretically work anywhere I want in the world and my qualifications will follow me is an amazing plus.  ","A time I worked well in a team was when I was the team leader for a competition and had the responsibility of prepping my team and getting them competition ready. The goal of my team was to successfully try to win as many mini knowledge-based competitions as possible which were all exam based. On the team I acted as the leader which meant that I had to split my team of around 20 other kids into mini teams based on their qualifications. This meant that I had to assess everyones capabilities and knowledge in certain topics and group them together. I was also responsible for making sure everyone stayed on top of studying and preparing for the competition. I accomplished this by making practice exams for each mini-team based on their unique topic. This meant that I helped make 5 different practice exams based in different areas of STEM. If I were to change anything I would have helped each mini-team individually rather than help everyone as a large group. This was because each mini-team had different qualifications that were needed and I delegated the tasks to them instead of micromanaging, but I believe if I had stepped in more it would have been beneficial to each team and the team as a whole. Even though I was the team leader I worked along side everyone on a mini-team myself and participated myself. This meant that I knew what would be helpful and what would not so I was able to apply this knowledge to any decisions I made. ","My personal goal in participating in the Sprinternship program is opening myself up to this opportunity and fully throwing myself into it and making the most of it. Another personal goal is to be more comfortable in a professional environment as I have never been in one before which by participating in this program I would gain the experience I need. On an academic level, I could see how the topics and ideas I learn in my courses could apply in the real world. Often times it is difficult to see how what you are learning will apply to your later on job experiences, this program would help me bridge that gap. I could also see how I could tailor my learning to better aid me in my later professional career. My professional goal would be to getting to talk with actual professionals who are already in the field and know a lot about it. It would help me form networking connections that could help me further in my career. Another professional goal for participating is gaining actual experience. As I have never interned in a tech based company I do not know what is expected of me. Participating in this program would aid me in gaining professional experience to enhance my resume and my credibility. While the point of internships is to learn, many internships want a candidate that has experience already. This program will prepare me for that and help me reach that qualification. ","Since this is an internship opportunity that is based in immersing oneself in a real world situation I feel like it would help me know what to expect when I graduate and get a job. I would not have as big of a cultural shock. I also like how Sprinternship is focused on the underrepresented communities at Mason. This would mean that those I intern with are also in the same boat as me and I would not be alone. It often feels like everyone how is an intern already has tons of experience and knowing that the community I am in is learning beside me is greatly helpful. 
I am apprehensive of internships because it feels like I am thrown into an environment where I am expected to have all this knowledge I do not actually have. With an environment that is just a quick and immersive experience there is less pressure and I can focus on what is important - actually learning and bettering myself. I also know that the people in this community would have similar reasons for doing this internship, which is to getting a foot into the field of tech as they also have no prior experience like me. This type of community would help me focus on what I believe is the goal of an internship because they too believe it.

I’ve also contributed to drawing the designs for the automobile and aided in printing a part of the model in order to affix it to our prototype. The project was a success since our group had completed it with a satisfying result and grade from our professor. My role in the team was helping in the organization of the team’s task. The things I would do differently from that time will be to make an effort to communicate if needed while learning to overcome my shyness and introversion from speaking up since there were times where I felt aloof and refrained from asking for help from group members and took matters in my own hands.","I want to participate in the Sprinternship program because I haven't had a prior opportunity to gain experience or apply knowledge in the tech field. I see the Sprinternship program as a good place I can start to gain experience which will be beneficial for my tech-career pursuit. I am currently taking CS 310 Data Structures this semester and the content and materials of the course are exciting because of the puzzle aspect of problem-solving which pushes me to focus on detail and making adjustments in the code using applied knowledge, and I'd hope for an opportunity to build my confidence in the tech subject through the program.","I have often heard and read of incidents concerning toxic workplace environments, especially discrimination against LGBTQ people and thus am aware I may experience micro-aggressions from my future colleagues for being out as trans-nonbinary in the workplace. Many jobs and programs do not openly state and enforce protection against discrimination based on gender identity which often deters and holds me back when prospecting for jobs or pursuing any career due to fear of being targeted or face harassment. However, this Sprinternship program stood out to me as a safe environment since there aren't many programs that have emphasized or provided a safe environment for queer and under-represented individuals.

I found out about programming through one of the classes, but never delved too deep into it as it was not a programming course. I found a website called Codecademy, which at the time had HTML/CSS/JS and Java courses. I went through the HTML course and felt this sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when I was able to complete a certain program or function. So I continued down until I finished the Java courses and realized that I was having so much fun that I didn't want it to stop. I went on to take programming/computer science related courses in high school which solidified my love with programming and is a reason why I chose to be a computer science major. ","When I was in high school, I joined a robotics team, specifically their software team as I liked programming but I had only built some small projects and nothing on this scale. I was one of the team members that helped out with writing the code, and was also someone who the captain would rely on to write the functions that the other members didn't have time to write.","I want to join this program as I believe that this program will give me the skills and confidence that I need to further pursue my career in tech.
