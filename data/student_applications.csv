In addition, there are many opportunities within the tech industry for growth, in other words, there would always be something to learn. ","When I was a junior in high school, I worked on a business plan competition in my business class with four other students where we were asked to develop a blueprint strategy to launch a new product or service. I suggested that we should first list common problems that consumers face on a daily basis.   I proposed that we should find an alternative that can help consumers maintain their phones' battery life. Although one of my team members was initially not welcoming to the idea, after displaying statistics on the number of consumers facing battery health issues, my team member agreed that this was a major issue that needs to be solved. I worked on the financial plans of the project, whereas my other team members worked on marketing, market analysis, and mission statement.  We ended up working hard as a group, receiving very positive feedback from our teacher, and became quarter-finalists of the competition. However, after reflecting back, something I would do differently is done more research on the issue. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I hope to develop my soft skills, such as communication, leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork, which I can apply after the Winternship program. In addition, I want to explore different fields within the tech industry so I can figure out what my likes and dislikes are, which can help me decide which job role I would be most interested in after graduation. In addition, the program provides a great environment to meet professionals in the career field I want to pursue, as well as other interns who have similar interests.","During my previous Winternship at Credit Suisse, I learned how to use several coding languages to develop a tool to help traders visualize bond transactions over two years of data. In addition, I learned how each language plays a different role to create the web application. I implemented these lessons in my economics class in which I was assigned to create a graph displaying economic trends. Instead of using a graph template available in Google, I was able to develop my own personalized graph, which was more appealing and efficient.  ","I want to learn in this environment and community because I believe this would be a space where all girls, including me, can share career advice and create opportunities for each other, together. Also, I want to be a part of Break Through Tech because it is trying to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry and create more opportunities for females in the workplace, giving me a sense of empowerment.

During my sophomore year, I volunteered at the Community Kitchen in West Harlem. I worked with a team of staff and volunteers to prepare food and serve approximately a hundred families in need with hot food. I have done multiple things to make sure the process went smoothly, such as communicating with the chefs in the kitchen and other volunteers in the pantry. There was a lot of teamwork involved as well. I worked with others to count the total of cans and food when the pantry shift was over.

As I currently work at an internship where I work with large amounts of data, I was able to witness the power of the technology. Before I started the internship, I solely learned excel at school without knowing the utility and application of it. However, during my internship, I see how much time a software like Excel would save compared to doing everything manually. One problem I do notice is that when the data gets too large, excel processes at a slower rate than it normally would and sometimes it would even crash, therefore, I would like to learn a programming language to help me to work more efficiently with big data while enhancing my technical skills, which is also one of the most important aspect of data analytics.

In that project, my role was the leader where I asked my team which of those parts they want to work on and I divided up the work accordingly. I also gave them an expected date of completion so that we leave some time at the end to add on to each other's work. We worked well together all the way through the end even though there was a little trouble on the day of the presentation. One of our team members was in the process of relocating to another state so he couldn't finish his part of the project and he told us on the day of the presentation. However, I was happy that all of us were willing to take on the extra part instead of pushing away the responsibility. The presentation worked out great but I did learned some lessons during this process. As a leader, I should have communicated more with my team members to prepare for any unforeseeable circumstances, and I'm sure that would have made our project smoother than it was.

Since our goal was to not leave the school too late, we decided that instead of each of us cleaning up our own equipment separately, it was better if we each had our own roles. So one person cleaned the pans by hand in the sink, one person had to operate the dish machine (which cleaned dishes quickly), and two people had to bring the equipment that was easy to clean to the machine and once they were rinsed they had to set up each of our stations again so we each had the equipment we needed for our next practice.

I have seen many technological advancements such as Electricity without which we would be in a dark, automobile which reduces distances among people and places, the GPS which helps us get to places, even Online Shopping which has made life easier during this pandemic since we do not have to go to stores physically to buy daily necessities. The use of technology in schools and colleges is what interests me the most. Despite being at home for four months, the institutes ensured proper education through online materials, the ability to take AP tests through Collegeboard without cheating, and amazing online graduation. If we did not have the technology then the last couple of months in quarantine would have been spent at home sleeping and having no communication with friends or teachers and having no education or entertainment. A career in technology would mean I would be able to be a part of an asset which creates the path of new technological advancements since technology is the future. ","I have worked in teams when I was working towards making a website along with a partner as our end project for Break Through Tech Summer Guild. The goal was to make a website base on our knowledge and learnings of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We decided to create a website named ""Menu Guide during COVID-19"". The idea behind this website was that many people are unable to get food depending on their cuisine, appetite, and religious restrictions. We worked towards creating a menu filter which included the following- Veg, Non-Veg, Halal, Non-GMO, Kosher Allergy related food, and different cuisines. For this project, I did coding in HTML and helped my partner code in JavaScript. I contributed my ideas of implementing Navbars, Drop-down buttons, and Cards from Bootstraps. We alternated our roles at different times to ensure that we both got to do both roles. I was the Navigator for the first half and for the second half I was the one writing the codes. Next time, I would try to add more codes in JavaScript to increase efficiency by using ""Functions"" and implement more Bootstraps to make the website looks more appealing. It was a great experience working together to make our first own website. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because it will expose me to real-world experiences and I will be able to get hands-on learning and techniques from experts. I hope to gain learning skills in the Computer Science field, gain experiences, boost my knowledge, and make new connections. My personal academics for participating in the Winternship program is to gain more knowledge and boost my experience of being a part of team, working in collaboration and increase my coding skills. My professional goals include me being a part of an internship that works towards opening new opportunities and new technological advancements.

This environment encouraged women to be a part of technological community and come out of their boxes. Even in my school, not many girls were eager to take Computer Science Principle and I think that is due to the stereotype that IT girls are very rare.

There was no set role because we all shared the work equally, I feel like that's why we clicked so well. There was no ""boss"" or leader because we knew what to do and had help when we needed it. The environment was a no-judgment zone which to this day, has been my top favorite class because I felt appreciated by my peers. One time, the neighboring lab bench had broken their test tubes so their data was skewed, so we let them join our bench because we knew how frustrating it would be. I feel like that's how teams are supposed to work - when one falls, you help them get up. I know all of this sounds cheesy, but these moments are the ones that stuck with me because it was so different than other classes.

Since Computer Science is a broad field, you can start off by doing one subfield like data science, but then as you keep working and making connections, you could find yourself at a different subfield. The tech industry is not only a place for someone who's just good in tech but also for people who want to make a change. That change can be small or big and it could be weeks or months or even years before they make that change. Everyone brings in something new into the tech industry. What interests me the most is more adaptive the tech industry is. The world is always changing and becoming more ""modern"" and the industry has to always adapt to how the world is changing. With every day comes new software and more devices and applications. There's no limit to what people in the tech industry can do. ","I worked on a team during my winternship at Dow Jones. The goal of the team was to work with the data analyst team on the Factiva Churn project to help find signs for churn prevention. I mainly worked on organizing the customers' data on excel and then using their data to find an unbiased group for our sample. I sorted the data of the companies from our sample and used it to make line graphs to compare and find signs in the data that would show that they were going towards canceling. Next time, what I would do differently would be that I would try to be more open and social. I would try to be more confident in my work and less nervous.  ","I want to participate in the Wintership program because I want to gain experience in the tech field. I've mentioned how I intended to minor in data science but I'm still not sure. I feel like doing this internship gives me more of real-world experience in the tech field and allows me to experience how I would do in the field of the internship I'm being put in. One of my personal goals would be to use this internship to figure out if I like the field, to make more connections, and gain more skills like not being nervous when I'm talking to a huge group of people. Academic wise, my goal would be to learn while I'm doing the internship. including social and networking skills, I'm going to learn skills associated with the field. A professional goal would gaining experience and meeting new people and making connections. ","I was planning to apply the skills and experiences from my previous Wintership by joining more clubs at college, however, the pandemic and the closing of many schools and programs didn't allow me to get on top of that. However, I did start looking into the different fields under the tech industry and tried different things at home like teaching myself the basic coding and trying to use what I learned to create things on my own like websites. I do hope I can get the opportunity to do more CS-related activities. ",I want to learn in this environment and community because it's less competitive since most of the girls in this program are supportive and understanding. Many girls are even in the same place I am and just working with girls seems less intimidating. Everyone wants each other to rise up with them and not just rise themselves. It helps us make new friends and make more connections. This program also gives us many opportunities that help us in school and gets us ready for the real world.

I attended the club since I was a freshman and have seen the changes that took place during my four years there. When we had our first board meeting, we realized that there had been a decline in participants over the past four years. Our goal became to recognize the problem, find a solution, and teach the next set of board members how to run the club after we were gone. We detected that because there was a decline in hands-on activities and an increase in informational presentations over the years, students started feeling bored and therefore, stopped attending. So we decided to change that; I took charge of increasing the number of events. I also increased the number of bake sales to build our funding for these events. With these changes and more, we saw an incredible increase in the number of attendees. However, we were unable to hold some events, for we also had to use a fraction of our income to provide snacks for each meeting. Of course, there were still informational presentation days, but we made sure that even a little bit of hands-on activity or video was included in them. We also tried to make the presentations short and to the point. I realized that it took time and effort to summarize points and make them short, so I requested that presentations be made in pairs. All board members agreed and so every week a different pair of board members took charge of the meeting, making it easier and therefore, providing them more time to do school work. We saw that this truly did improve the quality and ease of each meeting. Something I wish I had done, however, was speak to the principal for more funding for our club. I failed to do so for I was afraid he would decline, but I now realize that asking would not have hurt and maybe even allowed us to carry out all the planned events. However, I did tell the next set of board members to not make the same mistake and request the principal for funding. Despite my mistakes, I truly treasured my time as a board member of the club for I had gained lots of leadership experience from hosting events and problem-solving skills from the errors I had solved along the way. I also realized that working as a team greatly improves the quality of anything since there will be many unique ideas all the time.","	I would love to participate in the Wintership program for I will be able to gain connections but most importantly, gain knowledge of tech and experience in professional settings.

It is quite true that there are a lot more men in the tech industry than women and therefore, it is the same for tech classes. I have attended tech classes during my freshman year where there were only four women in the class while the rest were men. Sometimes it felt very intimidating to work on projects in my classes with the majority being men and so we started to feel inferior and slowly became afraid to ask questions which is the key to learning. However, if we are given more opportunities to work with majority women or only women, we can work together to build each of our confidence and become brave even during classes where there are majority men.

I would have never found that field if it was not this internship. It is a valuable opportunity, and I would like to learn as much as I can.    ","After my Winternship, I used my skill in my writing for engineers class. We were given a project to write a product description. I did mine of API's because that is what I learned in my internship and found one of the most interesting things. In one of my classes, we were required to make a proposal regarding one thing that I would like to change about my college.

As we all know, all of a sudden everything changed to remote and this made it really hard to communicate with the group members. We were having a hard time sharing our ideas. On the other hand, I like to complete the work on time, so  I took an initiative role by making doc files available to everyone mentioning the work we have to do. I also divided everyone's job in that project, so that they could complete that on their own time schedule.

There are many companies that are implementing tech in their long-term projects but the most popular thing that excites me is Fintech. Because I have always been so interested in both Finance and in Tech, the mixture of the two is mind-blowing. A career in tech gives me an opportunity to change the world, I know that statement about changing the world can sound very broad and hard to achieve but after I have helped to code an influential website like this: https://swingbyszs.herokuapp.com/home it has given me the opportunity to think I can do something to change the world. ","As Software Engineer Interns at LinkedIn, in three-weeks, we were in charge of making a demo website of the LinkedIn Live Video Page by overlaying a graph to the video for the viewers after-live viewing the video and making an Analytics page for the broadcasters to see the number of comments made during and after-live. I was in charge of designing and coding the Analytics page for the broadcasters to see the number of comments from a graph that can be accessed easily from the home page with a button. I played the designer role in the team since I was more comfortable with HTML and CSS, so I created the layout and figure out the color scheme then discussed it with everyone if they agreed with my designs. Some things I would do differently next time would be to figure out my tasks beforehand since every day was different I got flustered thinking about what task am I responsible off, therefore, making a calendar would have been really helpful. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I want to experience how it's like to work at a big tech company, also, network with a lot of professional people so I can learn from their experiences as well. My personal goal for participating in the Winternship program would be to meet different people from different fields because I'm an introvert who doesn't network that often so this will be a great opportunity. My academic goal would be to improve on my computer science skills and get experienced in big coding project work, also learn more about working on a team. Finally, my professional goal would be to learn more about working in a tech company and how work-life would be for me daily such as getting to know my colleagues, my manager, and finishing my project. ","Yes, I have applied my skills and experiences from my previous Winternship at LinkedIn to another academic and/or career opportunities. I applied to a lot of internships for over the summer but most of them got moved/canceled because of COVID. But so far, this summer I'm part of the SYEP Summer Bridge 2020 Program and WAVE mentorship program by Built By Girls. Also, my friend and I, Grace created this program called Her Toolbox where we teach high school girls about Design and Finance. We were supposed to start in August but we're now thinking about doing it over winter break for a week. Here's the website link: https://grace-cen.wixsite.com/hertoolbox Overall, I would say as a Software Engineer Intern I learned a lot as an intern at a big tech company, learned a new coding language Ember, got to network with the most amazing people and was able to put that experience on my Resume. ","I want to learn in this environment and community of the most talented girls from CUNY schools because we don't want to be underrepresented in tech careers anymore. We want to show the world that women are talented enough to achieve anything they wish for. I love being part of these women-focused programs like Built By Girls, Women of Rewriting the Code Fellowship they give women of our age opportunities to be bold and show off their skills to the big tech companies.

Twitter recently announced that its employees can work from home permanently, which sounds like a dream come true during the COVID-19 stay at home orders. Unemployment has also reached an alarming high during this time. Also, many of my friends are having trouble finding jobs in their desired fields outside of the technology sector. I feel with technology being seamlessly integrated into our lives, it's smart to take part in this growing field. With Breakthrough Tech (formerly WiTNY), I found myself, surrounded by a network of equally, if not more, driven and curious women paving a career path in tech. Having this support system keeps me motivated to stay involved in the tech industry. I'm interested in improving people's lives with technology. ","As a data science intern at Verizon this summer, I used machine learning to implement a technical solution to operational efficiency.  The algorithm (apriori)  I used, reduced the non-action alarms coming into the Wireless Network Management Center. Before this internship, I didn’t know much about machine learning other than training machines to beat humans at chess. With a steep learning curve, I worked hard to get up to speed with the team project so that I can create rules to filter out unimportant alarms. To minimize the workload, I proactively reached out to my manager and data scientist mentors to see if I can automate some steps to extract ML rules for the project. When stuck, I reached out to experienced employees for guidance on tackling certain tasks. My team's goal was the reduce the number of non-action alarms by implementing ML rules. I contributed 12+ new rules to the team during my internship ","I am passionate about a healthier world. I believe through technology, we can instill good eating habits and an active lifestyle for the general population. I want to build devices and software, that encourages society to be aware of their health. I am also interested in immersing myself in new cultures and learning new languages. I hope this winter internship can connect me to people that would like to work on tech projects to help improve people's lives.","I took an introduction to computer science and programming last spring which boosted my interest and skills in coding. I participated in hackathons such as one sponsored by Nestle and the Zahn Center of Innovation, which focused on health tech. I participated in a monthly mentorship program by Built By Girls, that connects girls to women in tech jobs Most recently, my Verizon internship opened my eyes to the field of data science and machine learning. I've networked and learned from tech professionals. These experiences encourage me to make friends with like-minded individuals that want to pursue a career in technology. WiTNY's summer guild program helped me realize my potential to make an impact using technology. ","I believe that when women are encouraged and supported, they can achieve and risk more. That is what being in the WiTY program taught me. To be firm, and hesitate less. I want more women to feel the same way I felt after completing the program, ready to disrupt the technology industry with my presence.

One instance, in particular, would be this past month in July 2020 when I participated in the BreakThrough Tech Summer Guild. This week-long program required me to constantly collaborate with my fellow cohort members through debugging games, user interviews, and coding labs. The goal of the Summer Guild was to develop and create a website with a partner based on the coding languages that we spent learning during the duration of the program (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).  	My partner and I were building a website that makes it easier for users to find new hobbies based on their personality type and potentially connect with other users online. In a team of two, my partner and I divided the work based on what skills we each excelled in. As someone who likes to keep things organized and is very meticulous, I took on the role of planning the layout of our website and debugging our code whenever any error occurred.  	Through this experience, I learned that when given a short period of time to complete a large task, it is important to constantly communicate with your team, to stay organized, and to continuously be patient. One thing that I would do differently next time is to further develop this project by exploring various new features to possibly add to our webpages.

Before this program, I didn't enjoy the idea of learning about computer science or getting involved in tech because it was a difficult subject that I had a hard time understanding. However, during quarantine, I realized that I should not feel discouraged of my past experiences with computer science and instead give myself another chance to start fresh. Although it was overwhelming to learn the intricate details behind coding, I was greatly inspired and appreciative of the wonderful community of empowered young women who sought to be challenged.      These young women were constant reminders for me to be persistent, and I was determined to make them proud by fulfilling my academic potential. In the process of coding, I was even surprised by myself who wanted the teachers to teach us  harder codes because I wanted to break out of my academic boundaries. In all respects, this program strengthened my patience as well as confidence in my work which is something that I have struggled with throughout my academic journey. These are two traits that are crucial to any career but are especially important with tech professions. A career in tech offers the tools and experiences I need to become a knowledgeable individual as well as an informed community member. I see the best version of myself emerging in a career in tech, and I look forward to the frustrating yet fulfilling challenges that come along the way. ","During my last month of high school, I had a Spanish group presentation as my final. I got to work with my two best friends so it was easy for us to split up the work because we were familiar with each other's work pattern. The goal of our team was to explore social inequalities that occurred in several Latin American countries and relate these issues back to the movies that we saw in class. I was in charge of fact checking our information to make sure they were accurate and to look for grammatical mistakes in our presentation. I wouldn't do anything different because I believe my group members respected everyone and provided exceptional work. ","Through the Winternship program, I am able to deepen my knowledge about computer science and even study about this field in college. I want to take advantage of this program because I know it is not easily accessible to everyone. As a result, I wish to partake in this and inspire other young women of color to explore the tech profession so that they are aware of the myriad of career opportunities. I hope to meet new people who can provide me with career guidance and insight that will enhance my relationship with computer science. ",,"I used to be insecure about my academic capabilities, especially in writing compositions. I mimicked words and phrases that I didn’t identify with because I felt that mine were not worthy. In the process of imitating, I was uncomfortable and frustrated with shaping my voice into something it wasn’t.Over the course of three years, I visited my professors and my school's writing center to ask for help with how to enhance my writing so that I could eventually develop my own voice. As time passed, I learned how to articulate my thoughts in a way that felt authentic and something that I was proud of. Break Through Tech would only intensify the desire to constantly improve my work and harness my vigor to create the best version of myself. I am so grateful for the people that I got to work with over the summer who made me feel proud of every small accomplishment that I achieved. I would take advantage of Break Through Tech to continue gaining confidence in my work.

In June and July, I participated in InternHacks' first-ever remote program where they combine the best aspects of a hackathon and an internship into one. It was a six-week program where we had to come up with a problem that is present in the world today and a possible solution for it in the form of a website or a mobile application. My team decided to focus on food insecurity especially during COVID-19. We decided to create both a mobile application and a website to help people facing food insecurity as well as for food banks to keep track of their inventory. We split up into two subgroups so that one can work on the app and the other on the website. I worked on the website and did most of the backend stuff. We wanted to store the details a food bank would input in the website which included name of the food bank, their address, their phone number, and their email address. We stored the data to Firebase's Firestore Cloud. I also helped with the overall designed of the website. In the end, my team won three awards for our project including ""Most Likely to Start a Startup""!

Well, maybe try my hand out at making a mobile application, but for the most part, I loved being apart of a team and creating something amazing in just a few weeks. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I would love to gain experience and develop my technical skills further. I would also love to experience what it is like working in a tech company. Overall, my goals for the Winternship program are to grow my experience, maybe figure out what I want to do after college, and finally, learn to go out of my comfort zone!","I haven't really applied my skills and experiences from my previous Winternship to other academic and/or career opportunities but I have been working on developing the skills I gained. For example, I learned quite a bit about machine learning with the use of Python and pandas in my first, and so far only, Winternship, and I have been working on developing my Python skills further as well as learn about the different opportunities available within machine learning. ","Tech is a male-dominated industry so it can be hard to find other women in the industry, especially if you're looking to build connections and a support network. By working/learning in an environment where it welcomes female-identifying students AND members of other underrepresented groups, I can not only meet amazing women with different experiences but also meet women who get the struggle by trying to break through in a male-dominated field. I haven't really taken any CS courses yet but from what I heard, in a room of 30 males, there are only 2-3 women so sometimes, it can be hard to build connections. By doing the Winternships, you get to meet women from other CUNYs and get to learn alongside with them for 3 weeks and build amazing friendships as well as an equally amazing support group.

Even though I only have three weeks during a winternship, I have retained and used the skills that I have learned and got a head start on what I need in order to succeed.

","I have participated in Winternship programs before, and it is one of the best experiences I've had professionally. As a Wintern, you are given much more attention from the company that you are at, as they try their best to expose you to different roles and thus people at each company. I have learned so much from my experience from each person that I am truly grateful to know. It has made me more knowledgeable and confident in going forward. The skills that I am exposed to is something that I continue to seek and I believe it will help me in my future career as well as the present.  ","I have definitely gotten better at networking with people in CS, which is not something you might find in a CS textbook. The confidence I feel I have earned from the experience, from a naturally shy person, has made me more fearless in going after opportunities I would not have normally applied to whether they end in acceptance or rejection. The CS-related knowledge that I was exposed to is not something to overlook. For instance, in my last Winternship, we were given a lesson to get an idea of how Big Data is managed and stored at the bank. I learned a lot about databases. The coding that we had to do for the project, made me a better programmer in terms of actually delivering a product on time and working together to create a running program into existence. I also had a better experience going into non-WiTNY internships which had mentors similar to Break Through Tech. ","Women and other select groups are still very underrepresented in tech, unfortunately, and that's why I think what Break Through Tech is doing is very crucial. In a world with such a large data gap for women and these groups in so many aspects, I want to help improve that statistic through my work and my presence. The large data gap is a problem that needs to be dissolved, especially going forward on new technology that thrives on data. It is great to be a part of something where you are surrounded by people who understand how important it is to have these people in tech and are on a similar mission.

Currently, I have a position as a STEM specialist where I teach young students about the different fields of STEM as well as the activities/opportunities they have in this area. The field of STEM has always fascinated me. When I was a young girl I was certain that I would be a math teacher. When I was in high school I took my first computer science course; AP computer science. In this class, I made my own games, gifs, slideshows, and even programmed a “bird” to run on its own through a maze. This is what sparked my interest in computer science/technology. Since then, I knew that I wanted to have a position in tech. Whether it be building/designing devices from scratch to developing the code for my project, front end/back end. Due to the current pandemic, it has been hard to take on opportunities so I sought out my own. I took part in an AnitaB study group this summer, where I taught myself Python and Javascript. After completing my courses and currently working on personal projects, my excitement and interest in tech grew dramatically. Knowing what I know now makes me eager to implement my skills in a professional work setting as well as learn in the workspace to become a better tech specialist.","As a student and as a professional I take part in different teams/groups. This past semester I took part in a team for my data analyst course. As a group, we all needed to come together to present a report on data that was assigned specifically to us. My team consisted of four people and because of the current pandemic, everything took place virtually. I didn’t know anyone in my group, only their names which were on blackboard. I sent out an email chain to everyone introducing myself and asking what was the best time for all of us to meet. I also jotted down their phone numbers so, if an email were to get lost, I could easily message them the files through WhatsApp. After our meeting, we were all assigned a certain part of the project that we knew we were comfortable with. I made sure that everything was in one master document and shared it with everyone. Whenever a change was made, I made sure that everyone was informed as well as updated when the data was changed.  As a professional, I take part in supervising and educating students. Usually, each grade is assigned 2-4 specialists per 25 students (This is prior to the pandemic). Now, there are only 2 specialists per 10 students in the room. While taking part in my summer job, I had 3 students along with my 2 colleagues. Each of us had a different shift, I usually worked the afternoon shift. As I was in commute, I make sure to text my coworkers the time frame in which I would be arriving in. We were all in a group chat letting each other know what projects we wanted to do with our students. This was a very unique summer but I treated it as normal; writing the schedule on the board, taking regular bathroom breaks, as well as enforcing social distancing.  With these experiences, I learned that I can be a natural leader in groups and that I appreciate other's feedback/questionings. When things became a bit difficult; losing contact with my peers or having to reenforce social distancing with my students; I learned to take a step back and breathe. Situations are never perfect and I must ride the wave. ","I am making a shift in my career from education to tech. Although I have much experience in childhood education, I have been shifting my gaze to STEM. I started this change when I implemented a Girls Who Code club at one of the schools I worked for. I then took on a position as a STEM specialist, teaching coding/computer science to 3rd - 5th graders. Personal changes came when I started teaching myself Python and JavaScript. Participating in the winternship program will give me the opportunity to showcase the skills I have as well as create a path to my new career in tech. I believe that you never stop learner. Education isn’t only found inside a classroom. One of my personal goals is to continue growing. Wherever I am, starting off as a receptionist I want to learn things outside my job description. I want to develop skill sets that will have me move up in business, for when I am a CEO, I could guide others on how to get to where I am at that moment. Professionally, I want to give out opportunities. Just as my personal goal, I want to mentor others and show how I achieved so much in that world's hardest times. Along with this, another professional goal I have is to give back to my community. I come from the south Bronx, there are many environmental issues and educational setbacks that I would like to correct and change. I suffer from asthma and the south Bronx is known for having the highest asthma rate in the entire United States. As a professional, my goal is to study the air quality in the South Bronx and develop technology and/or methods that will clean the air in 5 to 10 years.",,"Taking part in the winternship program will be an amazing opportunity for me to showcase the skills I learned. I want to learn here in the winternship/breakthrough tech community because I will be connected with other young women who will be developing their careers. I want to be apart of this community because I will be able to relate with other women about the process of securing a job in tech, what to prepare for, who I need to be connected with and what to show/provide when I am up for a position in the professional world.

It was very hard for me personally as I lost my grandfather and am in the process of moving to a new apartment. (Still in the Bronx, New York). I have felt very useless and inexperienced as a student because many opportunities were shut down. It bothered me so much I began to research opportunities for myself in which I could grow. I took part in a study group where I learned Javascript and Python. I am currently developing my projects to showcase my skills and practice what I have learned. Projects that I am working on is building a virtual assistant using python, a phone number validator, and a cash register using Javascript. ",,,Stephanie R. Almodovar,Stephanie Almodovar,0,4,No,No

One of my long-term career goals is to contribute toward a tech project that can inspire and connect people worldwide. Since I began college, I have come to love how I can combine the creativity I have always enjoyed with the logical structure of programming to create something that people can directly interact with and be impacted by for the better—from the full-stack website that I helped program to educate voters, to the narrative game I developed to share a cathartic experience with players, and more. Ultimately, I am fascinated by the potential of tech to reach people and inspire people that use it. By pursuing a career in tech, I aim to help create positive technology that does just that in a meaningful way.","As part of a CS initiative in my college, CUNY 2X, I participated in an intense, full-stack bootcamp alongside a small cohort over the course of a month. We were introduced to the common languages used in web development, such as JavaScript and React. As the culmination of the bootcamp, I teamed up with 3 of my peers to create and deploy a full-stack web application using React and Redux. We jumped into it with the week-long timeframe we were given.   My main roles were to act as the organizer, UI, and front-end developer. Our first goal was to decide on a purpose for our application. After brainstorming a page full of ideas, we decided on “Voter Hub,” an app dedicated to expanding voter registration and knowledge of relevant events and upcoming elections. I began to work on making all the UI wireframes with Adobe XD—having made one web app before, I realized how valuable it was to get everyone on the same page with a visual representation of what we would develop. After making them, we began to work in earnest. I focused on the front-end, developing in React and Redux by hitting API endpoints, styling the pages, and creating more wireframes as we came up with and improved on features. I drew both my visual design experience and the project management skills I developed in my other extracurriculars to always make sure the Github was up to date and issues were brought up and fixed.   By the end of the bootcamp, we had finished the app and deployed it successfully. Over that week, I had focused on keeping everyone in the loop while also programming the front-end. I also pair-programmed a lot throughout the stack to fix bugs that were easily seen by a fresh pair of eyes. It was a great and insightful learning experience, especially when it came to team coordination and using Github projects! Next time, I would aim to communicate even more with the organization of the code itself and how it is structured, and develop the back-end alongside the front-end instead of afterwards. If time allowed, I would also design multiple wireframe variations to see which one is preferred, instead of sticking with the first one that came up. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program to gain more hands-on experience in a real tech environment outside of college, both as a developer and as a professional. Academic-wise, I aim to develop my technical skills in the internship and career workshops. While I have learned how to apply my skills to school assignments and projects, I want to improve the quality of both my code and the approach I take towards solving technical challenges so that it approaches the standard of programming in a real tech company. I also want to participate in a Winternship so that I can develop my own professional voice and learn how to handle myself in a professional setting, from learning how to present my ideas and interact with other professionals in the company. On a personal level, I also want to grow the confidence in myself as a young member joining the tech industry, through the career development workshops to completing the group project of the internship.",,"As someone who took their first big steps towards a CS career in college, I recognized how meaningful it was to me to have a supportive community, especially in a STEM field. I was fortunate to join clubs and organizations early on like the Break Through Tech, Built by Girls, Out in Tech, and others that were not only dedicated to students in CS, but also dedicated to fostering a welcoming and diverse environment that made me feel like I belonged as a woman and member of the LGBTQ community. As a past participant in Break Through Tech’s career readiness and summer research programs, I recognize Break Through Tech’s devotion to their mission and felt supported in the community in such a way that I could grow as a software engineer and young tech professional. I believe that when a community like Break Through Tech’s helps you develop self-confidence, it also deepens your confidence in pursuing your academic, technical, and professional goals as well.

Taking on this leadership role was very important to me because Science Olympiad was a club I really enjoyed. Additionally, I was the club’s first female president in a long time. When I initially took on the role as president, I felt like the club was stagnant and few others shared my eagerness to thrive in the competitions. That mentality among my team members really reflected on our performance every year as we never placed higher than 4th place at any regional competition. Being president, I volunteered to work on the most challenging competition, which was mission possible. The purpose of the competition was to create a rube goldberg machine that completed a set of tasks within a time frame. As an underfunded public school, we were already at a disadvantage in this competition. But I wanted to prove to my younger team members that regardless of our setbacks, our efforts will be fruitful. A team member and I worked on the project almost everyday after school for a month. In the beginning the primary struggle was not knowing how to even begin such a task. I was too hesitant to even try out an idea until I was certain it would work because I didn’t want the attempt to be a failure. However, during the process, I learned that failure is the only way to learn. Each time one of our ideas didn’t work, we had a better understanding of how to adapt the idea to make progress. Failure also made it difficult to return to the project with the same enthusiasm we started with. We would feel unmotivated knowing there could be more failures. After countless failures and motivational speeches, we competed at the regional competition and placed 2nd in mission possible. That was the highest rank my school ever placed in the regional competition and it really opened my peers’ eyes to how far their efforts can take them. From that experience, I learned to prevent my fears of failure get in the way of my success.

I am fully enraptured by its  vastness and potential for me to experiment and find my niche. I also so appreciate that it’s a skills based industry, and that the more I learn the more I can accomplish. I initially started off as a pre-med student, but I grew very frustrated at how detached my curriculum, extra-curricular activities, and requirements were from my goals. In stark contrast I fell in love with programming because I felt like I was gaining real skills from my first day of class. I thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction of improving and learning more, challenging myself to think through tough problems and being apart of an environment that values curiosity and creativity. ","In high school I was on the Mock Trial team; I was one of three lawyers, each of us paired with a witness. We competed against other schools, and the goal was to win the case. Some parts, like the direct examinations, we could prepare beforehand; however, we had to think on our feet to answer objections, come up with our own and redirect or recross our witnesses. It would’ve been easy for each of us to just focus on our personal tasks, but what made us such a successful team was that we were always trying to help each other out. We would write notes suggesting objections or ideas to include in a closing statement. I really appreciated being apart of a team because I was able to fully devote myself to my friends’ success. In my senior year I was one of two team captains, which involved certain administrative tasks, but more specifically, I devoted more time to help newer team members prepare for trial. I appreciated the chance to give back what I had gained, and it helped me really hone in on my skills as well. However, next time I work with a team I hope to take more a backseat and spend more time learning from my teammates than guiding them. ","I would so appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Winternship program because it would help me get my foot in the door. I feel so intimidated applying to companies without any previous tech experiences, and a Winternship would really give me the confidence to do so. I also just want real hands on experience beyond what I’m learning from classrooms, textbooks and YouTube. Being able to see the day-to-day of a real company would not only expose me to so much that I’ve yet to learn, but also allow me to get a feel for what my future holds. Yet most importantly to me, because there is so much professional variety offered in tech industry, I would really appreciate the chance to be able to start figuring out what I enjoy doing and what I don’t. That way, I can start focusing more and more on learning about the areas that really interest me, so that when the time come for me to apply to jobs, I’ll know which ones will be the right fit. ",,"I’ve heard, more times than I’d care to recall, that women are “biologically” less suited to careers in the tech industry because they don’t do well with working with things and are better suited towards working with people. Disregarding all of the issues with that claim, for me, it was seriously the biggest deterrent towards pursing a career in tech. I consider myself to be a personable individual and because of this stereotype I really doubted my ability to be happy as a woman in tech. Then even after I decided to go for it anyway, I find that in all of my math and computer science classes, female students are the clear minority - and it’s very disheartening. I would therefore really appreciate the opportunity to finally be apart of a community of women who share my interests and passions, be able to build a network with the future women of the industry, and gain the security that I made the right decision.

My dream is to be a software engineer one day, I want to create innovative products and software that will make an impact on communities and society.   I want to have more hands-on experience in the computer science and tech industry. I currently have experience in front-end web development from my past internship experience, but I want to work with a bigger company and I want to make a more sizable impact.","For the end of my full-stack development bootcamp, I worked amongst others to build a creative application in a week's time. My teammates and I were pressed for time, but in the end, we were able to make our MVP work and code something amazing. The project is called CunySecond, and it is based on my school's platform called CunyFirst, which is a site that we have to use to apply for classes and is it very unoptimal to use. The UI is terrible, the site loads really slow, and there are indicators telling us that a class conflicts with another. So, my team and I recreated it, I worked on the front-end development side, programming the pages and working with JWT authentication. In the end, we were able to make it come alive.  I would love to hack to build something that would benefit society. I really want to code in order to create something that people would use to ease their daily ventures. Even if it helps them in a small way, or something even better, I want to have peace of mind knowing that I was able to design something that helped someone. I am glad that with programming, I could make anything possible, any small or big idea I have, I can program to make life easier.   I want to embrace my shyness and try to take the initiative in team projects and I want to learn sportsmanship and have teamwork! Most importantly, I want to create a project that has a meaningful impact.","I would love to participate in the Winternship program because I would love a chance to gain more tech experience in the industry. I would love to have a full-time job one day, doing what I love. It has been my dream since middle school ever since I started coding. My dream is to be a software engineer one day, and I want to meet others who could share their stories with me. Technology is a huge part of our world, and it is consistently growing every day as we speak, and I aspire to learn more about what new hardware and software are being released, and hopefully, I can get involved in working with those technologies as well. It excites me so much, to think about what our future in technology holds. Technology is really amazing because it brings a lot of people together, and we can innovate technology to create new features that can benefit the world.","My previous Winternship has helped me so much and I am so thankful!! I previously interned at Moody's, and my recruiter (Jen Brennan) has helped program so many events and activities for us interns. For instance, she set up a ton of meetings for us interns to meet and get to know and basically have a ""lunch/coffee chat"" with professionals from all over the organization. I gained such insightful and valuable knowledge of how professionals operate in this tech industry. Due to that internship, I have learned how to speak professionally with other professionals, and I started to take more initiative in attending more events. I attended the Rewriting the Code breakfast with Morgan Stanley, and I also attended more hackathons such as Hack @ Brown.","As a woman in tech, I feel as if I have a limited number of opportunities. I want to grow as a person, and as a woman in technology. I want to meet others in technology at an amazing company. I want to network with others and meet those who will inspire me and help me grow. I want to meet others in technology at an amazing company. I want to network with others and meet those who will inspire me.  Personally speaking, one of the most significant challenges I have faced with being a woman in technology is that others would look down on you for being 'different'. I currently attend the City University of New York, Hunter College, which is not a school that others would immediately think of when they talk about computer science. So every day in my classes, I was surrounded by males, and I would be one in 5 females, out of a class of 30. It made me feel so left out and ostracized, I didn't feel as if I could fit in like that. I solved this dilemma in a later time, but I shared this because I want to emphasize to other females out there that want to jumpstart their career in tech, but don't know how to, CAN, and I don't want them to feel as if they don't ""belong"", or that they don't ""fit in"" due to the high male concentration in the tech industry.

I created the functions to check for matching symbols in a line, storing user input, updating, and printing the board after every turn. I made sure everyone knew what class variable and functions were available, as well as how it is updated. We had combined relating functions into one function to optimize our code and avoid repeating codes, making the program more manageable. For example, we made a function to check if a player won by incorporating functions to check for matching symbols diagonally, horizontally, and vertically. I helped the team with debugging and compiling the code every once a while to ensure there are no errors. Additionally, I printed out class variables to test if every value is updated as intended.  Next time, I would communicate with my teammates more in the beginning and create an outline of what class variables and functions are necessary before coding to avoid confusion and multiple variables representing the same idea.

It amazes me that with quality-programming skills, one can work in nearly any industry they please. Programming is truly a jack-of-all trades career. Any cause or interest outside of technology needs programmers to build and maintain their websites, their big-data, automate tasks, test their software, build enterprise software for other businesses, and so much more. Programming makes one powerful. I feel like a wizard with a computer as my wand and coding statements as incantations.   My interests lie in writing software to help people in non-technical careers in finance make good decisions when doing equity-research, stock-market research, and high-frequency trading. In general, building financial software. I am primarily interested in using machine learning to make that happen. ","In winter 2020, I worked in a team of five students (including myself) at Aetna, A CVS Health Company in Hartford, Connecticut. We had three weeks to devise and present the technicalities of a prototype for a wearable device. This wearable device is watch constantly displays and updates to the screen the customer's vitals such as heart-rate, blood-pressure, oxygen-levels, and more. Our team-model was heavily collaborative, where we worked in an open space and every few days one student would take up the role as the scrum master (the short-term project manager) for the team.   On our first day, our team had to collaborate the back-end of the watch device. In a few days from then, we were to present our solution to our supervisors. The back-end means we had to plan on paper what database the watch would be obtaining the customer's information from, and how the information would be sent through cloud computing. My scrum master and the other three students planned it well, for there were elaborate drawings and hardware details on a large white poster board. However, I felt left-out and that I didn't have a chance to provide my input to our solution. I also did not understand how the back-end they designed worked. I decided to go with the flow and I convinced myself that it would eventually make-sense as we went deeper into the project. I learned  that this was very big mistake when I couldn't answer any of our supervisors' hard questions regarding the back-end. I again felt left-out when the other students in my team could answer it perfectly.   I realized that it was vital that everyone in the team was on the same page regarding the technology aspect because we had to present a cohesive solution that works. The next morning scrum-meeting we met with our supervisors, I clearly explained to my team that we should take time after work to review the back-end again because I did not understand it. I emphasized that communication was very important especially since our team had varying experiences with planning technology. The scrum-master and the rest of the team expressed how grateful they were that I spoke up quickly enough. After work, I was informed and fully understood the details. I also explained to my team that later on we would be programming in html and some javascript and we had to fully explain how the program works. Since we had different experiences of programming, it was extremely important that we immediately ask questions if something is unclear. When the programming began, I made sure to continually ask questions about parts I did not understand.",Break Through Tech (formerly WiTNY) has been extremely helpful in giving me technical experience I can put on my resume. I would not have gotten interview offers from several companies for summer 2021 technology internships if not for this organization. My plan is to graduate with my CUNY Baccalaureate degree with my two concentrations (Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence). I want to work as a programmer at the intersection of technology and finance using machine learning techniques. I also plan to simultaneously obtain my master's degree in computer science with a specialization in machine learning.

Our group will create a project that is a completely user-friendly GUI based with Java Swing functionality. In the case of Swing, this container is called a JFrame. My role in the project is a team member. In the project I learned handling events with action listeners, although our user can type in the amount they want to deposit, but it does nothing if we have not written an event handler that will execute when the deposit button is clicked. When the user clicks a button, the JButton component generates an event object. The JButton component that generated the event object is the event source. An event listener is an object that responds to events. If the source component is connected to an event listener, then the event object is automatically passed, as an argument to a specific method in the event listener. The method then performs any action that it was programmed to perform in response to the event.

The goal of this work is to create an accurate database that could be useful for those doing research regarding microbes. I am only a student research volunteer, but at the end of this program, I will have contributed around 120 microbes to the research, and the thought of that is amazing. I have made mistakes and faced obstacles, as it is not easy obtaining information regarding every single microbe.

I also wanted a major that inspires creativity and innovation. The skills that I learn in school can be applied to almost any field as modern digital technology is universally applicable. I believe that I can apply my love and interest in math and science to making positive contributions to the world. For example, I was recently exposed to cyber security work through my Winternship at Morgan Stanley. After hearing various successful and inspiring women talk about their work in cyber security, it has become one of my main career goals to enter this field. In addition, I think technology is becoming increasingly important whether we want it to or not, and it’s important to be well educated about technology and the internet.","During my previous Winternship, I was put into a team of 3 other college students and we worked with our manager and her team. Our project was to build a webform using technologies new to us including Flask and Twiki (web development tools). Along with the project we had additional challenges such as adapting to the acronyms and terminology employees use at Morgan Stanley in their everyday conversations. Given the short amount of time we had to build a functional product in a new and unfamiliar environment, I think a number of things worked well. Us four interns quickly identified our strengths and weaknesses within the first week; two of us were stronger programmers and the other two were more design/powerpoint savvy. Because we divided our work based on our different skills, I think we were able to work efficiently. We were such a small team that we had to take on each other's roles often, instead of having designated roles. This meant that part of the time I would take on a more managerial role, other times I would be coding individually. We also set daily and weekly goals that helped us work productively. The most challenging team-related struggle was when one of my teammates decided to work alone at home. We had progressed with one platform (Twiki) but we realized we had to switch to Flask in order to complete the project. My teammate did not want us to fall behind so she restarted the project by herself over the weekend without telling the rest of the team. It was difficult to catch the rest of us up on the project and get everyone on the same page again. Looking back on this experience I think it would have been much more productive to have planned how we were going to restart the project together. I think constant communication is the key to a successful team.  ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I believe it would benefit me in a number of ways. I want to meet other students from underrepresented roles in tech to support each other and be immersed in that community. I also want to meet women who are leaders in tech and learn about their journeys into the tech world, thoughts, goals, and advice. I think a Wintership would give me the opportunity to practice and apply my coding/computer science skills, as well as soft skills needed to exceed in professional work settings. My goal is to have a computer science related summer internship the summer after my sophomore or junior year. A Winternship at one of Break Through Tech's partner companies would give me the experience needed to acquire said internship.","My previous Winternship experience was extremely beneficial to my personal, academic, and professional goals. I gained confidence in my coding skills and in my ability to work in a professional setting. I also had an amazing time bonding with my team and meeting women who are leaders in tech. The women that I met and spoke to inspired me to continue to pursue my career in tech, and also to explore avenues that I hadn't considered before, such as cyber security as a career. While I haven't had any CS-related jobs/internships since my Winternship, I have talked about the experience in a number of interviews and conversations with professors/advisors to get other opportunities, such as my teaching assistant position for a computer science class at Hunter College.","I want to learn in this environment and community because it is made up of students who are in similar situations to myself. I think it is critical that underrepresented groups are taught the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the tech world, because our thoughts and experiences diversify the work place which benefits everyone.

Last year, I was one of three female-identifying students in the entire class. All of my computer science courses have been taught my men, and most of them will be taught be men in the future. This is yet another reason why I loved my past Winternship experience. Not only was I surrounded by people from underrepresented groups, they were also the leaders at the company where I interned.

Also, we have the opportunities of becoming an entrepreneur by opening startups. We also have the freedom to work as a freelancer if we have the right skills. I love how tech seems like a very specific topic or subject but in reality, it is everywhere and success in tech is a success for life.","We are always working in teams on projects. But one of the most important lessons that I learned was when I first learned to use git. As students, we always worked in repl.it for team projects. It was very helpful but also annoying at times when we had to test out code. When we first learned to use git, it was unlike repl. We had to divide our tasks properly and make sure that our code runs properly before we push it to GitHub.  As soon as we decided that we are creating a menu that allows someone to buy a pizza through our code, we had to divide tasks. As everyone would be working alone for their part, I planned on dividing the task of each individual into different phases. So that only when all five of us completed the first phase, we could move to the next phase and no one was left behind as it was a group work at the end of the day.  As we were learning to work in team but work individually on each separate task, the most difficult part was to divide the task equally, so some of the individuals had more work than others. After completion of this project, we improved ourselves by learning to divide task more efficiently.","During my school year, I always kept myself busy with school and job, so I never got the opportunity to take part in any internships. As a senior in school, I felt that it is time to take further steps in my career so I am looking for opportunities that will help me learn and move further in my career.  I also want to develop my soft skills as much as I can.  Participating in this program will allow me to get real-world experience and also a better chance to land in long term internships. As a senior in college, landing in one of these internships can be very helpful to improve my career in tech.",,"As a computer science major, most of the students in my class are men.

I transferred to a CUNY school from a predominantly white SUNY school, and while I left because of financial reasons, I'm hoping that in this new environment I will feel a lot more seen. It's difficult watching your professor talk at length with one of his male white students at office hours, long enough for there to be maybe 5 minutes left for you to ask your questions while you stand at the door. It sucks when you fumble over a problem at his desk for a while, 3 days into the first day of school, VERY first time in his office hours-- and he tells you maybe his class just isn't for you. I used to think you needed to be some genius math wiz to do computer science, and I'm pretty bad at math, but I knew I liked coding a lot.

People can communicate with each other from different places around the world because of the Internet. As someone who has always been highly competitive, I have closely followed and compared  Gmail by Google and Microsoft Teams. I’ve learned a lot about the methods that work in the tech industry and how each company is trying to add new features to their apps. I did not know that you can create and/ or join a meeting through the Gmail app. Both Teams and Gmail do the same job when it comes to calling, and sharing the screen, but Teams have more features than Gmail.  My interest in a possible career in tech started from the first computer class I took while I was in High School. I have already learned program languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Linux and I look forward to learning more programs as they developed. Being in the tech field means I will be able to learn, discover innovations, and ideas all the time. We are currently in a pandemic because technology students and employees are being able to take classes and work while in my home country Ivory Coast, where students could not go to school due to lack of technology and the internet. ","Last semester, I took a business management class where we had to work within a group of six to create a business plan. Our business was about a small technology company called Wellness of Technology that offers services to help our customers to know more about what they are buying and teach them how to use our products. We offer online classes for those who have access to the internet as well as in-person if the location is closer and. We repaired devices, our technical specialists handle ongoing hardware and software maintenance as well as rapid-response issue resolution.   I was handling the PowerPoint and Microsoft Word by organizing our project and I was the one that communicated with the professor and reminded my team about what they needed to do. I came up with the design and the logo of the company and I worked on the location, our main targets, and the location.

It has taught me to manage my time effectively, meet deadlines, adapt readily to new responsibilities, communication skills, work as a team member, and function well under pressure.  After my winternship of 2019, I was working at SUNY BEOC in Brooklyn While working there I learned that keeping a cool head during a confrontation is a must- and that arguing back with anyone in a professional setting doesn't help solve anything. Sometimes there will be disagreement at the workplace but if everyone tries to understand and listen to each other opinions then the work will be done fast. I have done a project on Machine learning in which I applied machine learning algorithms to a dataset of criminal activity to predict and take actions against criminal activities and potential security risks by using Python and its array of libraries.

My role was the walker so I was the one walking and taking precautions at how fast I was walking to create the desired slopes. As the walker, there was tape on the floor marking the distances so my only job was to accelerate and decelerate which was tricky. If I got the opportunity to do the lab again, I would take a different role to be the person setting up the computer and sensor. I would choose this because I saw my classmate doing it and he had to press and understand the different controls to get the required graph.

Firstly, before COVID-19 hit, I was active in various extracurricular activities at my college, including the Association for Information Systems organization and the Cybersecurity Club. I formed a group with three students to design a functional GUI using Python that allows users to manipulate entries, which store information such as a website URL, a username, and a password. Secondly, I joined Rewriting the Code as a fellow and attend various educational webinars because it is a great way to connect with others who share the same passion for technology. Thirdly, I will forever cherish the Break Through Tech Summer Guild 2019 experience. I had a great experience working with another student to build an informational news website while learning about product design and user experience research. Lastly, I attend numerous company hosted technology events, including those from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Microsoft, and Verizon. ",Yes,,,,F_31SfUYb6jBUcz9N,Debartolo_Alexandra_Resume.pdf,71170,application/pdf,"I am a life-long learner who has a growing admiration for technology. Technology is a broad industry that is fast-changing with a high demand for a passionate, dynamic, and innovative workers, such as data scientists, security analysts, digital strategists, and more. Technology is shaping the way we communicate, automate tasks, work with speed and efficiency, and store and share data, assets, and ideas. I am eager to launch a career in technology because I love building projects that have a positive impact on people and businesses. Technology is powerful because it touches everyone, turns concepts into reality, and its changing trends drive market forces, thus paving the future of our personal and professional lives. I want to be a part of the innovation that seeks to enhance the human experience, satisfy customers, and solve complex problems, whether it is through AI, ML, Edge Computing, or AR/VR. It is inspiring how many domains one can explore through technology. The scientific community benefits from using technology like robots, computer-aided design, and software development for research that aims to study the earth and beyond. The healthcare industry is using technology for bioinformatics, gene engineering, and medical diagnosis. Many other industries are taking advantage of 5G and Cloud Computing, working to improve the Internet of Things (IoT devices) that can make driverless vehicles, smart homes, and wearables much more efficient. I am excited to see technology evolve and mitigate problems regarding climate change, public safety, and education, as technology makes information universally accessible, personalizes customer experiences, and allows people and businesses to achieve their full potential. Because of this, I would love to pursue a profession as an engineer or technical project manager so that I can work on innovative, customer-focused projects that bring society forward. Together we can build a better future. ","I worked with three other students to plan, design, and build a digital campaign in five weeks. Our goal was to advocate the fight against human trafficking. We wanted to create a digital platform so that users can find background information, statistical evidence, and resources on the issue. We did this by dividing the tasks into categories: researching the problem, building the website, and creating social media profiles. Due to time constraints, we created a wireframe using Adobe XD, developed the site using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript with the Angular framework on Visual Studio Code, designed digital flyers using Adobe Photoshop, and managed social media accounts. We distributed the flyers throughout our college campus, and each flyer had a QR code that had a link to our website. We also used social media accounts to reach out to other anti-human trafficking organizations that promoted our presence to their followers.   In the end, we achieved our goal of spreading awareness about the issue of human/sex trafficking with strategic marketing and a user-friendly website. We had many wins as a result of this project. We gained over 100 active followers on our social media accounts, gained traction from various users through strategic SEO tracked by Google Analytics, and presented this project to a conference room filled with over 80 engineers.  This project was fun for many reasons. Firstly, I had a chance to use my design skills to create a wireframe for our website. Secondly, I contributed to creating graphs for the site using the Chart.js library in Python. Thirdly, I enjoyed being a front-end developer using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. I also had experience with back-end development, creating APIs to connect and integrate data from PostgreSQL. One challenge we had was styling the website to match our wireframe, but we were able to get it done using online resources and effective collaboration. Overall, I learned a lot about my love for coding and would not mind being a full-stack developer in the future.  Upon reflecting on this experience, I would do some things differently. I would use Agile/Scrum project management principles for speed of deployment; it would have been beneficial to do daily sprint meetings for continuous feedback and progress tracking. I would also use GitLab for version control because it would better prepare the team for the software development lifecycle in a corporate environment.","I participated in the Winternship 2020 program with Verizon on their Network Engineering team, and I loved the knowledge I gained and the ambitious group of Winterns and employees that I met. I believe that this Winternship experience goes hand in hand with my personal, academic, and professional goals. I am interested in pursuing a career in technology, so obtaining a technology internship helps me get closer to achieving my goals by improving my technical skills and boosting my confidence. I continue striving to become tech-savvy, which enhances my online productivity skills and helps me understand new consumer products or technology news. It also helps me overcome imposter syndrome by working to build something that will have a real social and business impact.   This Winternship will also help me reach my academic goals by reinforcing my technical and business knowledge and giving me a solid technical foundation that will help me succeed in my computer science classes. Additionally, I plan to go to graduate school for a degree in Computer Science, so any technology-related experience will help me narrow down what my desired area of research will be. This Winternship allows students like myself to gain valuable skills and navigate possible career paths, as I explore my interests and plan for future endeavors.   I have always aspired to be an engineer with a strong technical and analytical background, so this three-week learning experience gives me a chance to tackle real-world problems in a professional setting. This experience will strengthen my professional development, enabling me to enhance my developer skills while solving complex problems in a fast-paced and team-oriented environment. It is a great way to gain experience in my desired field of technology, which will be valuable during my job search after graduation. Internships are a vital component of breaking into one’s career of choice. The job market is competitive, and it is helpful to gain as much exposure to the field of one’s preference before graduation to optimize the chances of getting one’s dream job. Having internship experience as a student is helpful because I am building my professional network, learning more about which career paths and company cultures are the right fit for me, and gaining support in a learning environment. All of which can contribute to a successful future career in technology. ","The Winternship 2020 program was my first corporate internship experience, and I was fortunate enough to have that company extend me an offer to participate in their summer 2020 internship. The Winternship program helped me build my resume, expand my professional network, and boosted my confidence by working on a meaningful project and gaining insights on how companies leverage technology to maintain a competitive advantage.  Throughout my first Winternship, I learned about company operations and its best practices for building the best 5G network. I worked on a project that involved creating a proof of concept for a project management system for better collaboration and communication amongst internal employees and vendors. I became accustomed to using Google products like Google Sheets to display and manipulate data and Google Slides to create presentations, which are tools I continue to use in my academic projects. Throughout my summer internship with the same company, I helped build a customizable dashboard using what I learned during the Winternship, such as software development, project management, and time-management skills. Throughout the Winternship, I also gained valuable communication and presentation skills. These skills helped me excel during my summer internship because I felt comfortable pitching my ideas to my team, participating in informational company-wide webinars, and presenting my intern project to managers, directors, and VPs.  The Winternship inspired me to remain actively involved in other technology-related hobbies. When I am not participating in Break Through Tech activities, I continue to indulge in my love for technology through other means. I joined other organizations, such as Rewriting the Code, in which I mentor others on technology trends, self-branding, and career advice. I also use my sharpened developer skills to contribute to open-source software, and I work on personal projects involving statistical modeling using Python, R, and Matlab.   I appreciate the fact that I can apply for a second Winternship, and I would love to give back to others. If I recall correctly, there were former Winterns that returned for a second Winternship and mentored first-time Winterns on how to make the most of the opportunity, and I would love to be able to do the same. I am open to being an ambassador or mentor to other aspiring technologists, as we all help each other grow personally and professionally. ","I am a female who comes from a historically underrepresented family. Although my family has had little exposure to technology, I am committed to learning more about technology and how it can help consumers and communities, as I continue to pursue a degree and career in technology. I also hope to inspire other females to use our diverse, creative, and eager to learn mindsets to prove that we are capable of being distinguished technologists.   I grew up discouraged to pursue technology. I attended High School over four years ago and still remember how I was the only girl in my Java programming class. Throughout college, I have seen numerous women in computer science classes continuously drop out as the semester progressed. As unfortunate as this was and continues to be in some cases, I did not and will not let it discourage me. As of Fall 2019, I have been a full-time student who studies Computer Information Systems with a track in data analytics. I want to be a part of Break Through Tech’s positive initiative to make every female feel like they have a place in the tech sector regardless of their gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. All in all, I want to be a part of this uplifting movement to bridge the gender gap in the tech sector and inspire equal opportunities for all individuals.

Furthermore, I am aware of how women in tech are always underrepresented and hopefully by having a career in tech as a woman I can inspire more women to be in the tech or stem world. If I am able to inspire at least one woman to have a career in tech by being in the tech world, I would feel very accomplished.","I am currently working as a teacher assistant in Summer Guild Breakthrough Tech. I had the opportunity to work with different teams in the span of almost two months. The common goal of the teams I have worked with was to create a positive and supportive community for the students in the Summer Guild. Given the situation (pandemic) we all are in at this moment, this Summer Guild program was done virtually. Even though it was done virtually my team and I were able to create a positive, safe and supportive community virtually which was evident in the positive feedback we have received from the students every day at the end. I believe I was able to have a great impact on this virtual community since I would always get shoutouts from both my team members and the students that I worked with. There was one particular shoutout that touched my heart which I got from one of the students. She was older than the rest of the group and I made sure she felt welcomed and supported. In her shoutout, she mentioned how after she talked with me she had a great boost in confidence about having a career in tech and she was looking forward to continuing to learn more about careers in tech. This made me very happy knowing I was able to make a small impact on someone’s life and I would happily do the same for as many women as possible. Lastly, The only thing I would do differently next time is actively communicate more with my co-TA and divide up the work in the beginning of each class rather than only discussing the work in the beginning of each week.   ","Being born in a South Asian community, south asian females are only “allowed” to study in medical fields rather than engineering or any other stem-related jobs since engineering is apparently “designed” for men only. Throughout my childhood, I was told I am supposed to be a doctor and I have been forcing myself to like medicine and volunteered in different hospitals to get the sense of how this field looks like. I personally did not see myself doing this for the rest of my life. Therefore, I wanted to explore different things, however, I was super lost about what to choose since my entire life until high school I was in the hope of becoming a doctor in the future. However, I stumbled upon an application for Summer Guild last summer and since I love problem solving I decided to take a risk and sign up for the Summer Guild program where they taught us to build a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In that program, I found out how much I loved coding and how interesting and exciting coding really is.  Because of the Summer Guild, I decided to major in Computer Science in my college. I am still learning a lot of new concepts in Computer Science and I am loving the process. I want to expand my knowledge about computer science more by participating in the winternship program and hopefully by being able to participate in the winternship program I would be able to prove people who say tech is only for men wrong and inspire more women to break the stigma that tech is not only just for men! ",,"I am raised and born in a South Asian community, where women in particular are often not valued as men in the society. This kind of culture affects a woman’s mental health because she has to constantly prove that women in general could do a lot of things as men if not more. Growing up I definitely felt more comfortable with my female cousins than male cousins since there is no competition among us females about which gender is more superior than the other. Therefore, I absolutely would love to learn in a community where the majority of us is a female and there would be no competition among the genders of which gender is superior. Additionally, I have a strong belief that there will be more of a supportive community created by women supporting each other rather than a competitive community to bring others down.  ",Yes,Queens,NY,Yes,Permanent Resident,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"My college organized a codefest a couple months ago and after signing up for this I noticed there were barely women participating in this organization. I, myself, had to participate this organization with a team of men and I definitely felt very underrepresented while working with them. I felt like my opinions and ideas weren't as valued as the other members in the team. That was the time where I felt that I probably do not belong in the tech world since I had a feeling that this is exactly how a career in tech will look like in the outside world. However, I am trying my best to not give up and actually be an example to myself and other women that our ideas and opinions are as valuable as the other gender, but surely the journey is not easy!!

","During the selection process of the CCI Program at Brookhaven National Laboratory, I was interviewed. While being interviewed I was asked certain computer programming related questions which I was able to answer due to the winternship experience at Mastercard. The knowledge helped me secure an acceptance from the prestigious program. Moreover, due to the winternship I was motivated to opt for Computer Science as a minor. As I have recently transfer to CCNY from BMCC, I can not declare my minor until the Spring of 2021. However, the winternship helped deepen my interest in the field of tech. Therefore, this fall I have enrolled for a course that teaches Python. ","I want to learn in this environment and community because how beautifully it is structured and organized. Moreover, as it is an equal opportunity program, I feel comfortable and confident that I will not be denied because of my cultural and/or socio-economic identity.

I would watch Jim Browning gain reverse access to scammers' computers and figure out how the whole scam worked while notifying victims that they were being scammed. I would watch Kitboga spend multiple hours and even days with scammers to stall them and waste their time. One thing I came to realize is that these Youtubers were utilizing cybersecurity to help victims while making scammers' lives hell. It was amazing to see that you could both wreak havoc and help people who you've never met and likely will never meet just through this small device we call a computer.  Watching Jim Browning and Kitboga really opened my eyes to the different fields that make up tech and inspired me to pursue cybersecurity. What really excites me about a career in tech is that whatever fields you choose, you can always make a positive impact on people's lives and all you need is a computer and a secure connection!","Last January, I participated in the Winternship program at Morgan Stanley. This was my first time working in an office environment and on an impactful project so I was pretty nervous. When we were given our project description on the first day, I was lost. But because I was in a team with three other people, we were able to help each other out. When we sat down together to discuss the project, we were able to fill each other's gaps in knowledge and come up with a plan to tackle the problem. We realized our task wast to streamline a process through the creation of a web application. None of us at the time had any extensive programming experience but we did have enough to recognize which parts of the project we could tackle. In that way, we divided up the project among ourselves and assumed our roles as developers, designers, and managers.  My role was developer, so I was tasked with finding different software that would help us with the task and actually writing the code. I had another team member who was also a developer which helped tremendously because we were able to help each other out when we realized the other was struggling with something.  At the end of three weeks, we were actually able to present a working solution to our manager and the rest of the team. None of this could have happened had we been working individually because none of us had all the skills required to finish the job. But by working together we were able to pool our knowledge and background and make progress in such a short amount of time!   I wouldn't do anything differently because we had excellent communication and knew our tasks and deadlines well which was why we were able to complete our assigned project despite the fact that none of us had much experience programming.","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I want to explore the different ways computer science is being utilized in the real world. I think the winternship is a great way to gain exposure to computer science as well as meet professionals currently working in the industry. I think this last part is especially important because it exposes us to role models and opens our eyes to the different paths that someone can take to be successful in computer science.   Many students including myself have this image that the path to a career in computer science is linear and has to take place at a big tech company. But I know this is not the case because of the connections I've made during my last winternship. One person I connected with was Rachel Wilson, who is the head of Cybersecurity at Morgan Stanley. She did not start her career at Microsoft or Google but instead worked at the NSA for 15 years before she decided to enter the financial sector. Because of her, I became interested in a career in cybersecurity within the government and recently conducted an informal interview with her. None of this could have been possible had I not participated in the winternship last January!","During May, I applied to the Girls Make Games fellowship where I would teach a group of elementary school students game design. I had never actually played video games before so I was a little nervous but my experience at Morgan Stanley gave me the courage to apply. I saw it as an opportunity to learn and see another way that computer science was being used in the real world. I was accepted to the program but due to COVID-19, that offer was revoked.   So now with all of my summer free, I decided to work on my problem-solving skills. So every day I decided to solve a coding problem from Hackerrank. It was intimidating at first because I didn't trust myself and didn't think I was smart enough to solve a problem on my own. I remember the first problem I worked on, it was called Staircase. It took me two whole days to finish this problem which was labeled as ""Easy"" according to Hackerrank. During those two days, I would reread the description of the problem, break it down into manageable pieces, create test code for those pieces, and test the code out on paper using my own test cases. It was painful and there were times where I was tempted to see what the solution was but I stood firm and in the end it paid off. I came up with a simple recursive algorithm that passed all the test cases. Now, at the end of August, I've done many coding problems including problems labeled as ""Medium"" difficulty. I've become more confident in my ability to find a solution despite what little programming knowledge I have. The secret is perseverance.  Besides Hackerrank, I've been looking for resources to get my feet wet in cybersecurity and I stumbled upon Hoppers Roppers. This is a community that provides beginner-friendly courses to cybersecurity which are all free! I am currently enrolled in the course ""Introduction to Computing Fundamentals"" and I've already learned so much! I've learned what virtualization means, what a hypervisor is, how to install virtualization software, and create virtual machines. I've downloaded Ubuntu and created a meme using GIMP just yesterday.   Even though I did not have an internship this summer, I was able to learn and explore so much! I was also able to give back by volunteering with MASA and tutoring kids in fundamental math skills. I would consider this a productive summer!","As a woman in computer science, it can be intimidating since the field is male-dominated. As a woman, it's hard to speak up or ask questions because we don't want to be judged or thought of as dumb. That's why I think it's really important to have a supportive community where you're not judged. When there is no judgment, we can all share our thoughts and grow together.   I want to learn in this environment and community because I know I will not be judged when I reach out when I'm struggling and I know that I'll be given serious feedback which will only help me grow and succeed in this field.",Yes,Brooklyn,New York,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,,,,Baishaki Debi,Baishaki Debi,0,2,No,No

I worked well in this team as I contributed a variety of different ideas that could've worked when writing the code and helped with the revising of code. My role on the team was to help write code and run the program for errors and correct them. Next time, something I would do differently is try to play a different role to experience different viewpoints and see how others would approach the problem.","I want to participate in the Winternship program as taking an advanced placement course in high school based on computer science inspired me to pursue a career in tech. My personal and professional goal for participating in the Winternship program is to gain a better understanding of what it is like to work in the field of tech, and to hopefully build a connection that will help me add to my resume and find a job after graduating. Academically, the Winternship program will be a chance for me to learn and expand my knowledge of tech and help me perform better on future tech classes I take. ",,I want to learn in this environment and community as I believe it is extremely important that women interested in computer science and careers in tech are supported and empowered to pursue those goals.

The company (The New York Foundling) has a platform where all the informations are stored.  The platform is the main source of information for the data team. But there is an issue with one of the fields on the Platform (The notes of the clinicians after they see a patient.) it is not always fill by clinicians (Some of them just do not write anything.). Which often lead to an inaccurate result for studies which included how many patients did a clinician see for a given period of time. Since the patient has nothing to do other than to show up for his/her appointment, so the data team could not get any help from the patient.  A patient is considered seen by a clinician if the clinician put a note on the platform after the consultation.   Then during one of our meeting I proposed that we can consider as an alternative, the number of appointments(which were not cancelled) of the clinicians during the given period of time.

This is why I've been learning analytics from Python and SQL on the side of my academic studies. I hope to apply what I've learned in theory from my side online classes and in-classroom education to a fintech firm in a future Winternship!","Coming from a Korean-Chinese-Hawaiian-American background, I understand how it feels like to not feel belonged in a community that is well recognized and supported. When I first joined WiTNY in my last winternship, I realized that these women, all being diverse from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, were unconditionally there for me and were my biggest advocates in my career goals. One co-wintern of mine actually offered to help guide me through various coding projects post-winternship so I can further accelerate my learning.

In Fall 2019, I participated in the Tech Scholars Program where my team and I developed a C++ program cataloging high-demand job skills and presented the finished product to faculty panel at LaGuardia Community College. During the Summer 2020, I participated in the Break Through Tech Career Readiness program, learning many resume, networking, and interviewing skills, as well as establishing many wonderful connections with fellow students and industry professionals along the way. ",No,No,"I had a regular full- or part-time job,I had other personal or family obligations,I did not meet the eligibility requirements for the internship(s) I wanted,I did not feel confident or skilled enough to apply",,,,,,"Innovation and creativity excite me about careers in tech. In my prerogative, careers in tech allow you to create and innovate while utilizing transferable skills from other areas of your personal arsenal. For instance, I am interested in working in tech, but I have had experience in customer service and conflict management through previous work experience. I also love math, which has led me to tutoring in the past. A career in technology allows me to amalgamate my interpersonal skills, love of math, conflict resolution, technical saavy, and hands on experience into one great career to give life to new ideas. ","During my participation in Tech Scholars, we needed to create a C++ program and present it to a panel of faculty at the end of the session. I was collaborating on a team of five other students. Managing tasks for everyone to complete became a challenge due to everyone's different schedules and obligations outside of the program. I do my best to keep organized, so I recommended that we divide the work up equally and according to our strongest skill set. In my case, I was assigned to write one of the functions for the programs.  I coordinated the times that we would meet to work on the project and piece it all together. I also reserved the locations where we would meet to work, including library study rooms or meeting rooms. Most importantly, I followed up with my team individually to make sure that we were all on track to complete our respective portions of the work and to assist if there was a need. On our last day, I led our presentation by introducing our group members and each person's contribution to the team. During my next team collaboration, I would work more on communication between team members, as well as time management. It was very difficult to coordinate time around everyone's work and school schedules, but it is important prioritize tasks. I would also look up and practice different ways to effectively communicate in a team. Overall, the outcome was good, but there is always room for improvement. ","I want to participate in the Wintership program because I made a commitment to myself which is to participate in at least one co-curricular activity per semester. This not only forces me to step outside of my comfort zone as a shy person, but it provides me with a great opportunity to connect with industry professionals and fellow students. This Wintership will also provide invaluable hands- on experience that I will not likely receive any where else. A Wintership such as this one will allow me to fully immerse myself in the culture of my host company and learn as much as I can within the few weeks. I am fully prepared for that challenge.

I also took part in various hackathons presented by Code Interactive throughout high schools to expand my front-end HTML/CSS and JS skills.  Earlier this year, I was able to work with 7 women called The WiT Project where we were selected to participate in a software engiineering training program that empowers underrepresented female college students to break into tech.  We worked on a mentor-mentee matching web application written in Python using Django for the nonprofit YearUp’s mentorship program, to be piloted in August 2020 by ~100 users and projected to ~9,000 users in 2021.

Due to the evolving nature, there is always something new to learn.  Knowing that I would be able to expand my knowledge base excites me because I will never be stuck to a routine.  Technology is also a very challenging field, and as a person who loves challenges and faces them front on, its challenging nature also interests me.  With technology, the limitations of what we can produce is very minimal, which also excites me.  I can create various technological products that can be beneficial to anyone in the tech world, and I hope to accomplish that one day.","More often than not, I have worked in groups in class and in professional settings.  I prefer working in teams because it helps expand both my soft and hard skills.  I am able to be versatile and adaptable to any group setting. Some skills that I can bring to my team are organization, communication, and adaptability.  One of my favorite roles is to be a project manager within a team as I can organize the work and track success, as well as help my peers when they are stuck on any task. This enables the group to work together, and to be able to get success on a faster track.  During my winternship at Aetna, I learned safe agile and was able to play the role of scrum master.  I hosted daily stand-up meetings where my team went around and spoke about their work from the previous day and any work they were doing on currently.  I was able to also ask them about any obstacles they were facing and ensured I got back to them with a solution.  My project management skills also enable a skill for me which is communication.  Great communication is essential for any group project and I am able to communicate well with my team members regarding any fallbacks, successes, obstacles, etc.  One thing I would do differently is try to engage some interns with the things they enjoy more.  One of the interns was not interested in the work we were doing through the internship, and hence, did not participate much.  I should have sat her down and asked her what part of the project she would like to take up that she will enjoy doing because it would have made her feel more interested if I asked her what she would have liked to do instead of me forcing a task upon her.","My personal goal for joining the Winternship program is to be able to meet other women in the tech field who I can understand and network with.  More often than not, I see myself surrounded by men who may not understand the struggles of being a woman in tech.  I want to be able to network and work with women who on some level understand my struggles of being a woman in tech.  Another personal goal of mine is to show my little sisters that they can do anything they want, even as a woman.  I come from a semi-conservative family where my family in India is strictly against the idea of educating women and allowing them to work.  My parents decided to leave that culture in India and move to the United States to steer away from those conservative values and ensure that we get the education we deserve.  My family in India are still against us studying and working, however, every winternship/internship I land and every class I pass is me proving my family in India wrong and trying to make a change in their mentality.  I want to be able to inspire my younger sisters to ensure that they are confident and not scared in any educational and professional step they take in their lives.  My academic goal is to be able to take any skills I learn through my internship and apply it in school.  In school, we do not necessarily know how it is to work in a professional setting.  However, through winternships, we get to learn real-life experiences in a three week period which is amazing!  Lastly, for my professional goal, I want to be able to learn any skills necessary for the tech world and make connections with people in the company.  Since I am a rising junior, I have to start looking at full-time opportunities soon, and winternships will allow me to expand my network and have meaningful experience for my resume!","In 2019, I had the opportunity to work at Bitly for my winternship where I learned about Git commands and the React framework.  These two technical skills came into help to me for my professional year of 2020!  During the beginning of the year, I had the opportunity to work for a program called The WiT Project, which is a volunteer technical training program that encourages female college students from underrepresented backgrounds to break into tech careers through socially impacted software development experiences.  I worked with 7 other women in tech on a mentor-mentee matching web application for a nonprofit organization called Year Up written in Python, Django, and my Git commands came into use!  I also had the opportunity to work for Verizon this summer internship where I made front end enhancements to a network event management product using React and Git as well. ","I want to be able to learn in a safe and inclusive community encouraging female-identifying students as well as members of other underrepresented groups in the tech industry because it is important that the diversity gap is closing.  There is always a stereotype that women are inferior and incapable of completing STEM-related tasks.  However, that is completely incorrect.  There have been many women in the tech world who made various kinds of contributions.  Women bring a lot of value to the tech world that often goes unrealized.  One of my career goals is to be able to encourage many women as I can into the tech field.  One day I hope to not only make a major contribution to the tech world, but to be able to mentor some female or minorities to inspire, support, and encourage them to stay in the tech field.  One thing that helped me through my professional career is mentorships, and I would love to guide someone one day.

All the teammates were to contribute to give possible solutions to the problem and specifically, my role was a graphic designer and content editor.        The first solution that we presented was suggested by me, which was to build an app that will anonymously allow a person contact a professional counselor. The app will have other features like a diary, meditation video, inspirational quotes, it will also allow people to post their stories and get feedback from other people. Also for security system, the app will have a report feature that will be evaluated and potentially block the abusive user's account. After it was accepted by the group and the idea was revised, I also designed the app for this project.         I think everyone has done an amazing job to work well as a group and put in all the effort to make this project presentable in front of many honorable individuals such as the superintendent.

When I was first introduced to programming compared to the last few months of the class, I realized that in the beginning, the only thing I was taught is that when you press on this button, it does an action whereas towards the end of the year, I was able to successfully create multiple games. This class taught me that programming means that you will always be learning and that in the tech field, all ideas are welcome and that each idea tends to build upon each other. As a result, I wanted to pursue a career in tech because this industry centers around coming up with solutions to make it happen and with creating games, there was a lot of problem-solving involved which made me more interested in solving real world problems with programming. While I took this class, I also took a pre-engineering class in which we programmed robots to move and I became interested in how artificial intelligence can impact our world. There was something about programming and the idea of artificial intelligence that sparked optimism. With programming, there are so many careers one could do while artificial intelligence can be used to assist people’s needs and with the help of these two, we can accomplish ground breaking technology such as identifying patterns in each virus and be able to program bacteria with a specific genetic code so that it can fight against specific viruses. I’ve found out that I wanted to have a career in the tech field so that I can impact others even if it’s just an app that helps with their everyday lifestyle. Without a doubt, there are so many different innovations that involve programming and artificial intelligence that the possibilities are endless and for that reason, I want to come up with ideas and explore what we can do to make that happen.  ","A time when I worked well on a team is when I was part of this internship at CodeLabs and the goal of our team was to create a COVID tracking project that basically consisted of one or more micro-services in which we built a pipeline for automation, backend Java service and frontend to display the data using Vuejs and apexchart. Each of us had to create their own java/python application in which we each had to code a program that was able to get specific information about the COVID cases and parse that information so that the user can see it through the local host link. I was in charge of implementing the API for cases that were positive, number of increased, number of recovered, and number of hospitalized currently. Each of us was in charge of getting specific information in which each of our parts were crucial since in the final project, we had to put it altogether into this big project. Also, since this internship was virtual, I had no clue who the people I worked with were so I basically emailed all of them asking about their progress and created a google Google Hangout so that if one of us needed help, we could have asked each other. I was in charge of organizing our final presentation and made sure we were all working on the project. What I would do differently next time would be trying to communicate with my teammates before actually starting to work on the project because I felt like I created a Google Hangout too late into the internship and we ended up doing things last minute. It would have been better to introduce ourselves and set up zoom meetings after our meetings with our mentor to work together without the mentor guiding us so that we can discuss what our next goals are so that we can start working on it and if we have any further questions, we wouldn't be confused.  ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because of their career building curriculum they provide within three weeks. This program has a specific curriculum that gives students advice on how to get a career in the tech field in which it prepares them for the virtual mini internships. This layout is very appealing to me because with these career development workshops, it guarantees that we have a fundamental knowledge on how the system works in the tech field and how to get a job. The way that this program is organized  tells me that their goal is to give students opportunities to learn rather than just giving them a project to work on with another company, and instead, they focus on ensuring that students fully understand how to get started on a career rather than pushing someone with no knowledge of coding into dealing with restful web services or web development. Not only is this program’s curriculum appealing to me but also, the mini internship gives me the opportunity to learn from real life employers and to take note on what skills are needed to work together in a team and what to expect in the future. By working in a team, it will challenge my skills and I can understand the different perspectives while growing as an individual. As a result, this guarantees we are building up our teamwork skills and problem-solving skills. The opportunity to learn how to master our technical skills while being provided a glimpse on how the setting is in a tech industry will enable me to grow and use my weakness as my strengths. My goal is to learn how to successfully tackle a real life problem and be able to work out these problems with my teammates. This is because I want to be able to collaborate with others since I learned from prior experience that everything is much easier when you communicate with others due to the fact that our ideas tend to develop or strengthen upon each other. In the future, I will be collaborating with other teammates on a project, whether it’s in the courses I take in college or in other internships, this program will enable me to learn from others and learn how to work together successfully. As a result, this program will allow me to advance my skills so that I can grow and develop ideas on computing while understanding how others work their way around difficult problems that may arise.",,"I want to learn in this environment and community because it encourages underrepresented women to pursue careers in the tech field. There aren’t many programs that want underrepresented women to embrace their talents and regardless of the stereotypes about the jobs women can get, this program presents a safe environment where women can better develop their skills without being afraid of challenging themselves. Whereas in the real world, although men have better-paying jobs than women, this program seeks to provide a voice for women so they can be heard in the tech industry and not be undermined by others. I am drawn to how this program breaks the stereotypes of only men being programmers because it closes the STEM gender gap by ensuring that programming isn’t driven by gender, but by curiosity. Since there are many famous women who have contributed to the tech field in various ways such as Grace Hopper, this program provides future generations to follow into these women’s footsteps. This environment is appealing to me because of the way it embraces and welcomes ideas. With all of us working together, it builds a thriving interconnected community that will allow us to feel the power of technology.

Tech, whether it be coding, building, etc., is used to innovate and create solutions to problems that people have faced for a while. I want to be apart of this effort to continuously improve the world as we know it, whether it be through improving medical equipment, creating new modes of transportation, or even just making someone's day through a cool new app. ","Throughout my years of high school I ran a club with my friend where we would have people from a program called ""Lifestyles For the Disabled"" (a program made to teach valuable life skills to developmentally disabled people) come to our school and we would do various activities with them, such as create movies, learn how to use AutoCAD, and perform shows. This required a lot of effort, as we had to work with the school, teachers, students, club members, Lifestyles, and others to make sure everything went smoothly and was possible. We had a cabinet of students put together for the club, and as a team we all worked to make sure our weekly meetings were a hit with the participants. I was responsible for communicating with teachers in order to get materials and spaces to use, record and file attendance, provide meeting ideas, prepare materials/programs for meetings, and supervise meetings as they took place. Some of these responsibilities were shared with others, and other parts of the cabinet had their own unique duties as well. If I were able to do it again, I would have loved to invest more time into working with the organization itself, whether it would be through an internship/job or volunteering. Nonetheless, together we were able to create a weekly event that the Lifestyles participants always looked forward to!","I would like to participate in the Winternship program in order to improve my knowledge of tech as well as gain meaningful experiences within the field. Personally, I want to have a strong grasp on this subject, as I believe it will teach me skills and tools that can better me as an individual (such as improved problem-solving skills, logic skills, etc.). Academically, this Winternship would help me further visualize how my studies would be applied in the real world, as well as further improve my knowledge so that I may excel in my courses.

I know that a career in tech is very valuable. I truly believe it is super important to have technology skills. It is 2020 and we as the people are living in a society and time where technology is applied in one way or another in our daily lives. I am excited to learn more about programming. I want to be able to solve problems within a business and execute their goals efficiently. I want to evolve with technology because it is always evolving as time passes by. There is so many ways I would be able to apply these skills in a lot of departments and that is what excites me the most.,"I was in a group with a total of four students and we had to create a PowerPoint presentation to the class with the goal to persuade others to try a veganism lifestyle and/or to be at least aware of its importance. I introduced the idea of picking three topics that we would like to present. After doing this we would hear each others topics to see which one we would follow through with. One of my classmates had offered the idea of veganism. We all came to agreement that veganism was the best topic to talk about because it resonated with all 4 of us. She was a vegan for many years. One classmate and I did not eat pork and minimized our meat consumption. In addition, our very last classmate would support vegan leather products. So as a team we concluded that this topic would be strong for us to present. Although, I am an introvert, I am usually the one to encourage good communication. I engaged a lot and made sure we all had some form of contact so whenever we had questions or confusions on what was going to be presented, we were able to all chat to stay in the loop at all times. When I work within a team, I always ask for their opinions or suggestions on what I worked on because I believe that when two or more people collaborate and communicate efficiently the final work will be executed efficiently as well. Something that I would have done differently would have been to use zoom because it is a better and faster way to share work at the spur of the moment. On top of that, it would have allowed us to be able to have more presentation speech practices! Lastly, if I had known how to use HTML and CSS, I would have definitely incorporated that into the project one way or another! ","I have always shied away from ever considering a career in tech. Whenever I saw coding I would be amazed and wonder ""how is that done? I would love to try it one day."" However, at the same time I would be like "" I can not do that."" When I heard about Summer Guild from a friend, I couldn't resist myself from applying so I decided to apply due to my long time curiosity. To be frank, I am very glad I did so. This was my first big step into being introduced to the field of tech. I enjoyed the program and I decided I want to continue onto this journey. Personally, I have not had a clear pathway of what I want for as a career but once I got involved with Summer Guild, it has made me more curious. I know now that I want to have more technology skills. At the moment, I am still figuring out how I will approach a career in tech. In addition, I would practice the skills taught by the Summer Guild Program during my own time. Normally, I would not do this if I was not interested in the subject however after being introduced to this, it has been making me want to push further ahead to gain more knowledge. I  would consider myself as an introvert but I am still growing as a person, so pushing myself out of my comfort zone was a major step for me. Although, I normally do not dare to step out of my comfort zone, I will do it in this situation because I am excited to learn more even if it means I will be in an uncomfortable position at times. My second step would be to participate in the Winternship program because it will help me develop more skills and help me get a glance of real life experience in the tech field. I just need some help to get more involved which is why I really want to participate in the program. The Winternship Program will be an opportunity that will allow me to be more involved and connected to people in the industry. Ultimately, doing the Winternship program will help me succeed. Lastly, I am thinking to minor or major in computer information systems for the next semester. I want to major in computer information systems however I will admit that I am having a hard time switching majors because I am scared. Although I am scared, I know I will push myself to make a switch. I am eager to learn programming so I have been looking for organizations that offer free lessons. One option that was shared with a Bloomberg employee was TheKnowledgeHouse unfortunately, they were no longer accepting applications. Ultimately, my goal is to perfect my skills in HTML and CSS. My next step would be to hopefully be part of the Winternship Program and to learn a programming language along the way. I’m leaning towards JavaScript so I can be a front end developer but I would also like to learn more about back end developers. My path may appear a bit fuzzy at the moment but I know 100% that I will incorporate tech skills in my future.",,"I would love to learn in this environment and community because it is all inclusive of underrepresented groups. I am a Hispanic female and first generation of my family. Positive and encouraging environments are the best because it does not bring one down, on the contrary it uplifts and support one another to be great. I would not have been aware of Summer Guild or Winternship without the help of my friend. She and I are both part of the female community.

From my Winternship experience, I had the opportunity to work with a team and create a website for a new LinkedIn product that will appear in the future. From my technical skills, I used HTML, CS, Ember JS, GitHub to create a user-friendly route to identify over live 300+ comments on LinkedIn video web application. I am thankful for the opportunity because it gave me more knowledge of how to create a side project during my spare time. I made a website to make a networking matching app so any students can be pair with a mentor who has the same interest. I was able to use HTML, CSS, and Python (Flask). Thanks to LinkedIn, I realized the importance of networking and connecting with people who are out of our range. I also learned how I should pitch myself in a networking event from the Match Day workshop, which was hosted by WiTNY.

I have had my fair share of family losses due to human error, and I wanted to find a way to ensure that human error would not be a reason for why any individual loses a loved one. Moreover, I have a passion for wanting to help those who are ill in any way that I can, especially those who will not get the chance to live the rest of their life simply due to medicine not being advanced enough to save them. I believe that there is a solution to all illnesses, and that it is just the matter of finding the cure. It is the combination of technology and medicine that will lead me to work out the problems I have been attempting to solve for my entire life, and why I chose the Bioinformatics path. ","A moment where I was able to work well with my team was during my Winternship at Girl Scouts of Greater NY this past Winter. My team and I were instructed to collect and utilize troop data from Salesforce and find solutions that would help the company attract more girls to enroll for the following fiscal year. I was in charge of taking notes any numbers that stood out and present them to my team to come up with solutions. Though my team was able to successfully come up with solutions and present it in a Powerpoint by the deadline, there were some issues. There were times that a team member would not come in for the day, and the rest of the team were left with no means of reaching her. Since we were pressed for time, the rest of my team members and I decided to continue working for the day without her. However, when our absent team member showed up the next day, she presented us with work that she had done from home, which led to some difficulties on where we should proceed to reach our final solutions as our data collections were now inconsistent amongst our team. What I would do differently for next time is establish a solid form of communication before we even begin the project; this will ensure that my entire team will always be on the same page and thus, produce the best outcomes for the companies we are working for. ","I believe that I am a great candidate for the Winternship because I possess all the characteristics you may be looking for. Not only am I warm, kind, smart, a fast learner, and ambitious, but I am well-rounded. Given my background, I have experience in both medicine and technology meaning I have the ability to easily pick up on medical related information and making that information easy to understand and assess through the use of a computer or medical related software. I am projected to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in 2022. I plan on enrolling in a master’s program right after that, and ultimately become a candidate for a PhD in Bioinformatics. With that, my goal is to work in a hospital, a biotech company, or a health informatics related place where I could have the opportunity to make the use of technology and medicine easier and more accessible for the mass majority. Being in an interdisciplinary field like bioinformatics, means that each day will always be filled with unexpected events, which suggests a fast-paced life. I enjoy the idea of this and hope that my career path will provide me with a conducive and rewarding lifestyle that will not always stick to its daily routine. ","There are many nuances that come with becoming successful in the technology industry that I would have no clue about if I did not participate in this past Winternship as well as Fall 2019's Career Readiness Program. The skills I have learned from these experiences have guided me into becoming a better candidate for jobs I intend on applying in the future. Additionally, making me more confident for my interviews and as well as becoming more aware of making strong connections with those in the Tech industry.

Working in a team alone is hard, but with the remote situation currently made it even more difficult. However, getting to know my team gradually made it easier for us to bond and to get to know each other better in the work environment. One of my team members became the glue to make everything work and played the role of a leader. We would have a Trello board to place what we needed to do and this allowed us to be more organized with who was working on what and what had already been done. We also had frequent meetings 2-3 times a week. This made communication more clear rather than texting/ We would always write down what each person wanted to discuss before each meeting and what we needed to work on at the end of the meetings. Of course, sharing our code with each other and asking for help constantly made it easier as well. Also, our final meeting helped recap what worked as a team and what didn't to further reflect on how to work better as a team.  ","Since I am still a sophomore and have not declared my major yet in computer science due to the prerequisites, I sometimes fall into imposter syndrome when it comes to what I know compared to others.

However, when participating in my last internship, I realized that even though most of my peers were older than me, it wasn't a competition of who knew the most, but more of a benefit for each other.

However, what I have come to love about the technology sector, is its versatility which allows me to be adventurous. Given its ever-expanding nature, I know that with a specific set of skills, I can still explore a range of options until I settle down on a specialty. And since I am characteristically indecisive and impulsive, this flexibility excites me to consider all my available options.  ","During my Fellowship at Diverse Influencers, my team and I had to design a company that combated either a social, or global issue. Therefore, my team and I came up with ""Corporate Clean,"" an eco-friendly company that provided consulting services to other companies to help reduce their carbon footprint from the world.  As a Technology Fellow on the team, I contributed to making the company's website, with the help of another Technology Fellow, that included information on the company's mission statement, services, and allowed the user to make a consultation appointment. Apart from creating the company's website, I was also one of the two Presenters, who had to pitch the company to the guest judges at the finale of the Fellowship Program.   Although my team did not win, we did a commendable job, and I walked away from this experience having refined my professional skills. However, one issue that I faced was a communication gap, due to COVID-19, between me and the other Technology Fellow in my team, that caused me some problems. Next time, if given the opportunity, I would make sure that I have established at least two different forms of communication with my fellow teammates so that I am able to convey my ideas and concerns better.

On another note, I also think that this Winternship program will help me find the connection between my college coursework and the skills that they translate to in the technology field. If so, the relevance will actually help me academically as well as allow me to have a headstart professionally since I will focus more on honing those specific coding skills.

Being aware of reality, in order to compete with this difference, I always compared my coding skills with my male peers and internally competed with them. However, unlike their high schools (in New York) my high school (in Bangladesh) did not provide any opportunities in the Computer Science field. Therefore, naturally, my male peers had a slight edge over me which severely demotivated me and made me question myself for choosing Computer Science in the first place. I remember the calmness and excitement I felt during the Summer Guild and Technology Fellowship. I actually learned a lot within a short span of time and made a lot of friends throughout the programs who helped me grow as a coder. I feel like I lost a lot of my drive during my Spring semester this year by constantly feeling lesser than my male peers.

","I have recently applied to a coding program that teaches how to create apps instead of websites. Since I am familiar with coding websites, I wanted to branch out and learn how to code for apps and since both require coding, I used some of my website knowledge. An example is when I wanted to change the color of cards that I used. I knew the basics of how to change colors on a website and so I tried the same code for the app and it worked. Of course, the code isn't the exact same but knowing some website coding definitely helped in creating the app. ","I want to learn in this environment because, like me, there are many students who are female and want to pursue a career in technology.

By speaking to these mentors, I learned that I don't have to be a flawless coder or really good math, but what I need is the motivation to learn. A career in tech means that I would be learning everyday and that is one of my personal goals. Technology is always changing and growing and being at the forefront of that change would be thrilling since I could really make a difference in the world ","One time I worked well on a team was recently at a virtual hackathon that I participated in with my friends. The hackathon was called Techacks and my team created an app using android studio that incentivizes studying without looking at your phone, by giving you a random cat character to add to a collection of cats once your studying interval end. Our goal was to have a functioning app that had a timer, login page, cat collection page (to see which cats you've already won), & a way to detect whether the user left the app to use their phone and not study. I helped create the navigation bar and so that means I helped connect all the different pages together. My role was not only to work on the connection of all the screens of the app but also to create the video demo for our team. For my next hackathon, I would like to work on different features of the app and not only just helping them connect them. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I want to experience a tech internship at a tech company. I already participated this past winter, however, my matching process got a little messed up and I wasn't able to receive a match until 2 weeks before the program started. I wanted to apply again because I hope this time I can get a new experience at a new company, whether it be a startup or a big company. My personal goal for participating in this program is to meet new people to add to my network and create a project that I will be proud of. My academic goal for this program is to learn a new tech skill that I haven't had the chance to practice at home because it requires a group or company to produce. My professional goal for this program is to experience a different tech industry setting and learn about work life in different kinds of tech companies whether it be virtual or not. ","Thanks to my previous Winternship I have been able to talk about my experience there when applying to the CUNY Tech Prep program and I have also been able to apply my new data mining skills to hackathons I have attended. At the Winternship I learned how big data is dealt with and how processes work. With this knowledge and exploration, I was able to apply it to my academic coursework where I used databases and I was able to understand them much better. ",I want to learn more about myself and where I see myself in the tech industry. Though I have taken many computer science courses I still can't picture where I may work in the future and through this program I was to learn what kind of environment and community best fits me. New experiences always teach me more about myself and how I can strive to be a better person and I'm very interested in seeing how the Winternship will change my outlook on myself and my views on the tech industry. ,Yes,Staten Island,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"Although I'm very appreciative of how much my last Winternship taught me, I feel as though my experience was hurt for when I was enrolling with my match.

My team's goal was to finish a project where we had to create scripts as many as possible for testing company's various websites. In this project, I created more than 2 scripts and presented our presentation in front of the employees of the company. The most difficult part of this project that we were given two desktop computers for 5 of us. Even though 3 of us received laptops, it was not appropriate for the project (creating scripts).In this case, me and my group partner worked on scripts by sharing desktop while the rest of the group members worked on our final presentation.  When our group was stuck in creating scripts, me and other members of the group assisted to solve the problem by researching.  For the next time, if I face similar situation, I will like to organize first about who will do which task before start working. ","Challenging myself and solving problems are my favorite things to do. Fortunately, this Winternship program opens an opportunity for me. Not only from this program I will be able to challenge myself but also it will help me to learn various skills and engaging with employees. Participating in this program will give an opportunity to learn about various programming languages as well as gaining this experience will help me to get jobs related to tech. ","My previous Winternship helped me to learn any programming languages in a short amount of time. For example, whenever I engage myself in college workshops (related to teaching programming languages) or in an online problem-solving project, it becomes easy for me to learn any programming languages and apply it to real-world such as creating a website for my business.  ","We cannot imagine our modern world without technology. Technology makes it easier for us to do daily activities. Unfortunately, in this technology world, men are most likely to engage with technology than women and underrepresented groups. As a woman and from an underrepresented group, I want to engage myself in a tech career to decrease the gap between men and women. All Break Through Tech programs will help me achieve this goal so that I can influence underrepresented women and groups to participate in a tech career by sharing my story and my achievement in tech.

The class was difficult and hard to understand for most of the team members. The goal of the team was to understand and pass everything that had to do with the class. Since there was a group of five of us then there were two people that were able to learn the material at a fast pace. So they were the people in the team that would explain the most difficult concepts and keep everyone up to date that was confused about weekly class content. My job was to schedule weekly zoom meetings to study calculus concepts from the textbook and to collect feedback and what I and the team can do better. When there were tests, quizzes, and homework due in two days then I would alert everyone on a group chat so that everyone in the group can stay up to date. This was to help team members avoid being worried about not knowing something that had happened on a particular day. I may have not been able to learn the material as fast as anyone but if I knew something and someone needed help then i would offer my help to help a team member avoid confusion and setbacks in the class.

Maybe there are skills and other requirements I'm missing that I am not aware of. Learning in this community will help me be motivated and take more risks than the risks I am taking today.

One of the main goals was to make the dwarves collect as much lumber as they can because if they did not have enough lumber then they were not able to build a fence to protect themselves from the zombies which will result in the game-ending.

Due to the lack of women in computer science class, I am excited to have the opportunity to find other students who are so eager to grow and accomplish our goals together. Furthermore, having a support system will give me more confidence to keep pursuing my career goals. As for my academic goals, I aim to improve my analytical and communication skills. Also, gain a better knowledge of the tech field. Therefore, this will allow me to understand my future career goals at a deep level. Lastly, my professional goals are to make connections and learn about the company culture. This will give a sense of what it is like to work in a professional setting. Therefore, I am excited to work with a team who is passionate about growing. ","From my previous Winternship, the task was to create an application that will automatically save our clients' information to open their bank account. The problem that I faced was a lack of communication. To solve this issue, I spoke to the leader to set up a meeting plan to divide the work by making charts and data that adjusted our work. As a result, I learn the value of asking questions, organizing my time, and networking with my manager and my team. Thanks to my experience, I have more confidence in working with a group, open myself to other people who have a higher status, and we were able to gain more courage in presenting my course work. Furthermore, I was able to gain connections with other employees. This helped me in my future events on how I should prepare for interviews. After the experience, it gave me the strength to learn more about technology and attended to many coding workshops.  ","I am eager to learn in this environment and community because I want to inspire young women who are not exposed to tech careers opportunities. Breakthrough Tech Programs encourages me to participate in different tech fields, and it shows the power of women in tech careers. I also want to collaborate with other young inspiring females and know about their experiences in the tech field. Also, this environment makes me feel safe and helps me to grow and portray my talent.  Therefore, I would love to be a part of this community.

","As President of my high school's Gay-Straight Alliance, I was one of the people in charge of organizing school-wide events centered around the LGBT. This particular instance was about organizing for Transgender Day of Remembrance in 2019. That year, the number of hate crimes and murders against transgender people, particularly black trans women, had broken another record. The current Presidential administration had rolled back on legal protection for transgender individuals, further exasperating the issues facing the transgender community. Working with volunteers from the GSA, we decorated the entirety of our school with Pride flags. In the lobby the students entered through in the morning, we set up a 10-foot wide banner reading TDoV, with the letters of each word composed of the names of trans people who'd been murdered that year. Afterward, a vigil was held in which all those names were read out loud.  I was in charge of organizing and mediating these efforts. We had two deadlines to meet: TDoV and freshmen orientation. We wanted incoming students to know that despite the homophobic and transphobic issues affecting the school and the greater community, there would be no tolerance for silence here, that there is push back against intolerance and bigotry, and that they are not alone.  While we were able to meet the deadline, we met it last minute. Even outside of group work, my greatest vice has always been time management and taking on more than I can realistically handle. There are so many things that I want to get done, and that's why I often overestimate my own time and energy. I need to let myself ask for help. I need to be better in touch with time.

Starting January 2020 to the end of spring, the fellows were separated into four teams to create a business plan and website (combining the skills of fellows that were interested in Business and fellows that were interested in Technology.)  I was assigned to be the leader for my team. Unfortunately we were short on one member but the team was able to take the challenge. In the beginning stages of the project my teammates and I developed a business plan that targeted outdoor advertising, allowing outdoor advertising agencies to analyze the impact their advertisements had and connecting them with potential consumers. I facilitated the business and tech tasks for teammates and communicated with our advisory coach on task completion and how we can improve our business plan. As one of my teammates was new to web development, I assisted her during the biweekly workshops where we learned HTML and CSS. We communicated on the design approach of the website in regards to color theory and placement of information, implementing those features afterwards.   During the final week of the fellowship, we presented the business plan and website to members of the organization and professionals in business and technology industries. I am happy to say my team was awarded first place!  If there was anything I could do differently, I would have liked to make agreements earlier in the project on what business plan we wanted to work on. This would have allowed for better planning of what features were necessary for the business presentation and website. I would have also contacted professionals in the industry so my team could receive feedback on what we can potentially improve. ","I am an aspiring UX/UI designer and front end developer! In January 2020, I had my first Winternship with BestFit where I had my first technical-related role. While it was more design oriented as I was a Product Development Intern, it was a great learning experience that allowed me to discover my passion for UX/UI design and make meaningful connections with my mentors and teammates! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I am looking for more opportunities to create a positive impact.   Through the Winternship program, I would like to improve my current skills and integrate code and design into products. I hope to collaborate with creative minds while maintaining different responsibilities and learn from professionals in the career paths and industries I am interested in. More specifically, I would like to work closely with designers and developers and have transferable skills for both roles. Since I haven't had the opportunity to take web/mobile development or UX/UI courses at Hunter College, I would like to use the skills I acquire from the Winternship into future projects for hackathons, coursework, and my portfolio. ","As a Product Development Intern at BestFit I learned the fundamentals of UX/UI design. Prior to the Winternship, I had no knowledge of UX/UI design but realized it incorporated my interests in art. During the three week period, I learned how to conduct user surveys, construct user/task flows, industry standards of ideating and designing a product, and build wireframes and prototypes. I also had the opportunity to use software such as Marvel and Adobe XD.   I have applied my skills from the Winternship into projects outside of my coursework. I referred to design fundamentals and worked towards responsive design when I worked on my fellowship project in Spring 2020. From August 18th-19th I attended ctpHomeHacks and was a UI designer for my team where I was tasked with designing the interface of a mobile app. Unlike my Winternship, I was able to work closely with developers and see my designs incorporated into assets and code for a functioning app. I used Adobe XD and learned new techniques within the software throughout the hackathon.  Currently I am conducting a personal project as a UX Researcher and UI Designer and redesigning the CUNYfirst Portal. I have applied the same practices I learned from the Winternship such as conducting surveys and wireframing. I am also learning additional software such as Figma for wireframing and prototyping using my prior knowledge on Adobe XD. ","When I decided to switch my major to computer science in Spring 2019, I found it difficult to connect with any community due to my lack of skills and knowledge of the subject and the tech industry. However after attending the Summer Guild in the same year, I had my first instance of forming meaningful connections with female students interested in tech. I was able to meet those in a similar position and learn new programming skills and present my work. This positive experience made me excited for the other programs Break Through Tech has to offer.  During my Winternship, I was able to meet those with similar skillsets and learn new technologies and skills that weren't available at my school. I was comfortable expressing my opinion and experiences with my peers as female students in CUNY. Furthermore, I became confident in my capabilities and sought for more opportunities to grow. I noticed the same results with other Winterns where they became involved in internships and organizations that had similar aspirations to Break Through Tech.  It is important to me that my peers feel comfortable in the workspace without the impression their gender and/or background is an interference. I can relate to the experiences of female students that felt their skills and voices weren't as valued as an underrepresented group in computer science and the tech community in general. Without a safe and inclusive community, I believe many would be limiting their potential, worried to collaborate with others, and not view themselves as a valuable asset to their team. The environment and community the Winternship program offers allows female students to grow their skills and be confident when entering the industry, which would be a great example for other organizations to follow.

Because this field is always changing and coming up with new and innovative products, there is always space for learning and exploring. In this field, I can always explore new interests and while applying technical skills to build creative products.

Though we all individually created our own prototypes, we worked together to research possible solutions and contributed it to the final prototypes. I also worked on interviewing some college students and recording their responses to get a better understand of their daily life as college students and give my feedback based on interviews conducted.

I was also the designer for a school club called ACM where I designed posters and flyers for upcoming events and any important information that had to be delivered to students. While making these flyers, I applied the design skills I learned from my previous internship with BestFit. I was able to design posters that visually attracted the audience while delivering the messages without making the flyer look too crowded.

But I cannot compare that to the satisfaction and happiness I get when I work together in a team. I think it is more powerful and insightful to work and figure things out together as a team. I clearly remember when me and my three other classmates were grouped together by our International Studies’ professor to rewrite a newspaper report within 10 minutes. We were intimidated at first and confused as to where we should start. At first, each of us began to read the report individually but soon realized that it would be too time consuming. We quickly decided that it would be best if we equally divided up the newspaper among us to read and then discuss what we have read. While we were discussing it, I began writing the outline and organizing the many ideas we had. My teammates were glad that I offered to create the outline since it made rewriting the newspaper report much more easier. Eventually, we were able to successfully complete the assignment on time. Next time, I will make sure the work is divided right away if there is a time constricting group project. ","For the past few semesters, I have been struggling to understand what I can do with my CS degree. There seems to be a lot of opportunities in this field. By participating in the Winternship program, I hope to move forward and try to find the right fit in this field and start achieving my goals. Through the Winternship program, I would like to expand my networking skills and connect with people in the tech industry. In the process of doing so, I will gain a clearer insight into the hiring process for tech roles and understand how I can better prepare myself to get offers in these roles. Furthermore, I believe that this program will help me build my self-esteem. I will be more confident when speaking with new people and have an easier time stepping out of my comfort-zone. Altogether, the Winternship program seems like a great opportunity to achieve both my professional and personal goals. ",,"There have been times when I have walked into a CS class and found an overwhelming number of male classmates to female classmates. At first, I ignored it and didn’t think it mattered. My views changed though as I consistently found myself in this situation. To top it off, I consistently saw my male peers get accepted into positions that I have been rejected from. These rejections have started to make me doubt whether there really is a place for me in the tech industry. Now, more than ever, I need to be a part of this environment and community. I need to see other females who are also struggling like me. I also need to see females who have overcome their struggles and made their place in the tech industry.

I would like to share my thoughts through this question that by opening opportunities like this, Wintership program, Break Through Tech, and other similar programs are taking meaningful steps for the future of women and their representation in this field.  I can say this because I, myself, was discouraged to declare a major in Computer Science until I became a part of the Girls Who Code program in my junior year of HS. I was able to work on hands-on experiences and projects with my fellow-female interns and learn from the two amazing female mentors who helped me boost my confidence to decide that I wanted to pursue a career in tech.

I found myself in a state where if I answered or got a question wrong, I was viewed by them as inferior in those areas. One of the most uncomfortable events personally to me was at a physics tutoring event after school. I stepped in, saw the entire room of male students and staff, and having been the only girl, I felt out of place. It was this peculiar feeling that dug deep down, I felt so wrong to be at a place that once felt like the right place to be learning the subject I enjoyed.

Technology is not only present in the majority of our everyday lives, but it can also foster change in communities through innovation. I am excited to have the opportunity to build technology that has the possibility to offer solutions to issues that affect people on a daily basis. I am eager to create innovative products that can stimulate change and reform. The field of technology constantly introduces new concepts and technologies that will affect our future. I believe that technology is the way forward, as it allows for higher efficiency and streamlines everyday life processes and decisions. Additionally, as a minority, I can redefine what it means to be a woman in tech, and inspire those from under-represented groups to pursue a career in STEM. I also have the opportunity to redefine technology because of the unique perspectives I provide, ultimately challenging the status quo. Technology affects the way we live our lives, and by pursuing a career in tech I believe I can create an impact in different communities and redefine what it means to be a minority in tech.  ","This past summer, I participated in the New Technologists Summer Academy, where I was tasked with building a web application that addressed social disparities with empathy. My team and I decided to build an app that focused on the healthcare industry, specifically young adults who are new to navigating the healthcare system. As young adults, there is a lack of accessibility and transparency regarding affordable healthcare services. My team decided to create an app that centralized information on doctors including services offered, prices, and other information including ratings, allowing users to make informed decisions on healthcare services. I contributed to performing user interviews. Through user interviews, we were able to build a product that met the user’s needs and learned about information users prioritized when looking for a healthcare provider. I also built the doctor’s profile page in the web app, which displayed information that helped users make an informed decision regarding which doctor they would like to visit. Through this project, I was able to expand my technical skill set by learning new coding languages. In the beginning I spent time trying to learn the languages on my own and it was definitely a challenge. One thing I would do differently is to use my teammates as a resource earlier on in the project, and communicate my challenges with them. After I started getting comfortable with asking questions I was able to learn more, and more effectively on my team. ","I believe that the Winternship program will allow me to make an impact through technology. I am committed to using technology for social good and the professional environment will allow me to further myself as a woman in the STEM field. There is a prominent issue regarding the gender and minority gap in the tech industry, and participating in the Winternship will empower me as a woman in the tech industry. It is evident that women can make an impact in technology, but the voices of women and minorities are constantly unheard. As a woman in tech I believe I can bring unique perspectives to the industry and build innovative technology that stimulates reform. Through technology, we can impact communities on a much larger scale, and also show that minorities are fostering innovation and change by making their voices heard through technology. I want to participate in the Winternship program because it is an opportunity for me to expand my technical skills as a female in the STEM field. I will also be able to join a diverse community of people who share similar experiences in tech, and share my goal of creating an impact through technology.   ","One skill that I learned from my previous winternship and applied to my career opportunities is agile development. At Bloomberg, I learned about agile development and how it is used in the tech industry. Agile methodologies allow for effective collaboration across teams through sprints and standup meetings. This methodology has also been used in my past summer internship and during my time at the WiT Project. I was initially exposed to agile development at my Winternship, and that allowed me to work more effectively in my career opportunities that followed by providing me with the skills to lead standup meetings, and plan sprints for my teams. Agile software development effectively outlines the tasks that need to be completed, which sets the team up for success. Additionally, I learned how to make my voice heard in spaces where women are the minority. At Bloomberg, we had a workshop called “I Am Remarkable”, which taught me how to be vocal even in spaces where my voice is not represented. Although this is something I’m continuing to work on, this experience showed me that women belong in the tech industry. The workshop showed how widespread the issue of representation is, and I always refer to this experience when I feel alienated in the STEM field. The workshop at Bloomberg made me feel supported, and understood, and showed me that my voice belongs in the tech industry. ","I would love to learn in this environment and community because the community of students involved in the Break Through Tech program, share similar experiences with the tech industry. In a classroom setting, I am usually the only woman and it discourages me from being vocal about my ideas and connecting with my classmates. Even in corporate spaces, voices of women and underrepresented groups are silenced and unheard. By learning in an environment with those who share similar experiences and backgrounds, it fosters an inclusive environment that encourages unique and diverse perspectives. I will be able to connect with other minorities in tech and join a unique community of people who share my goal of creating an impact through technology. By hearing unique perspectives, I will be able to challenge the status quo with my peers, and also gain insights that will allow me to approach technology in a different way. Additionally, by joining a community of minorities we will be able to amplify each other’s voices, instead of being silenced.

I once had a conversation with a BME student who was graduating soon and entering the industry with a job in tech which I considered was unorthodox. She had told me that her job would entail different aspects of coding: software development, data analysis, and so on. As a sophomore, I was confused about how this transition from working in the labs and taking the research-based classes as BME would relate to working in the tech industry. However, after completing my junior-level classes, I have realized that BME provides a good foundation for a career in tech as we learn coding in python, Matlab, and also get a good feel and foundation of how programming languages work. I remember learning about HTML and making some novice website with dancing fonts and bright background in 8th grade in Nepal; however, I haven't had the opportunity to further explore my interest in tech. Hence, this opportunity would be a great resource and I'm excited to see how I can utilize my engineering and technical skills to further my interests and explore more opportunities in tech. ","Last semester, I was taking a class called cell and biomechanics. After schools had transitioned to online, we had to work on a group project researching the topic of scoliosis, a condition where the spine has an unusual sideways curvature leading to various physical and psychological deformity, we had to prepare a poster with different aspects of this diseases like conducting mechanical analysis to decide the number of forces and torque applied by the surgeon while fixing the deformity, the device used and it's the design and design improvement. While school was online, I and my teammates were all focused and working great as a team. However, with everything being online and having to discuss everything over the phone or google hangouts, things weren't the easiest as we have to schedule everything in advance, and finding availability for everyone was hard. After noticing that things weren't running as smoothly and our work wasn't being done on time, I took matters into my own hands and led the team and assigned jobs by motivating and encouraging to help each other. I was able to resolve some misunderstandings among my teammates and get the group working together and in cooperation. I worked as a mediator and problem solver which was one of the reasons everyone appreciated our final presentation and we ended up scoring great. I believe in teamwork and collaboration as we get the opportunity to engage and share each others ideas and knowledge. Through this project, I gained some project management, communication, and technical skills. ","Tech is a booming field and the kind of impact you can have via this medium is immense. I have personally seen how it's the application can range from business, finance, and so on to health care and social well being. This internship will give me the opportunity to further explore my interest in tech and allow for a better understanding of working in the tech field and how I can implement my engineering and technical skills to contribute to this field. I have had a friend who suggested I apply to this program because of its emphasis on encouraging women in the tech field. Being a part of a program like this allows me to have a great network of teammates and mentors while I learn skills necessary in tech from experts themselves. Hence, I would consider it a pleasure to be a part of such program. ",,"Living in New-York for the past 6 years has given me a great deal of perspective and exposure. Similarly, going to city college and engaging with students from all over the world has shown me that there is not just diversity in skin tone, cultures, and backgrounds but also life experiences, knowledge, and what each one of these people brings to the table. Working alongside international students who barely sleep 4 hours a day compelled to work lower than minimum wage jobs to pay tuition, single mothers who balance their household responsibilities along with time-consuming school work, and women from a family background that doesn't believe in educating women who fight their family to get what they deserve. I have learned the lesson of perseverance, hard work and not giving up when the time gets tough. There are always things we feel like we don't have but it has taught me to be grateful for every single opportunities that I have been given and work hard towards achieving my goal. Hence, being in such an environment has not only helped me be more competent in academics but also taught me a great life lesson. I am very positive that being around people with high drive and motivation to achieve great things at Cornell tech will inspire me more to achieve my dreams. I expect to learn technical skills and know more about people from diverse backgrounds at Cornell tech. Hopefully, if things get better  I get to meet these wonderful people at Cornell tech in person and be inspired by them and their stories.

However, some fields of engineering like mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering certainly have a lower representation of women. As a BME, I've noticed that 3/4th of the class population is female hence it motivates me to urge more women in the tech field and engineering.  However, after joining CCNY, I haven't seen much people from Nepal in the tech and engineering field which is why I always encourage other people from my community to get higher education and motivate them to aspire for better by volunteering in the Adhikari foundation in Jackson height. I always encourage older women (aunties) in the communities to send their daughters to extracurriculars and pave a path for them to advance their careers in science and technology.

The goal of our team was to create a dashboard in Tableau. I was knowing nothing at the beginning. I watched a lot of YouTube video that it's for the beginner. In the end, I created dashboards to simplify raw data into a very easily understandable format that can be used by the company in the future. I learned and created action filters and parameters, calculated sets, data cleaning, and applied. The role I play on my team was listening to other's opine and told them about my idea.

I learned a lot from them: technology, communication, etc. After Winternship, I declared my major as Computer Science. I think I found my passion. I can spend a few hours sitting in front of the computer staring at my code looking for bugs. Although it can be very tiring sometimes. However, every time I press ‘run’ and it works. It can make my day.  My goal for participating in the Winternship is to learn new things from other colleagues in the company that I could not learn in college and used the knowledge I learned to bring value to the company.","After the last internship, I became confident in my class. I also participated in several school activities related to CS. Unfortunately, the summer internship I applied for was missed due to the epidemic. So I chose to take some summer classes.

Having these interests are all achievable, because in this field I can change directions just by learning the language and technology that I need to work in these different jobs! ","Over the summer I participate in a hackathon called InternHacks. My team created a productivity application, ZoneIn, that blocks distractions on your workspace using a chrome extension. My role on the team was programmer and Product Manager, so I worked on creating an informational website alongside the extension through the use of HTML and JS. I really enjoyed working on the website, since I was able to use different graphic designs and HTML layouts to properly reflect what our application was about.

In high school, I thought the best way for me to advocate for inclusivity and accessibility was through technology. As I’ve continued in my computer science endeavors, I’ve been able to work on projects at school and in hackathons that allowed me to drive change through data and social entrepreneurship. I’m always looking for more opportunities to learn and technology has allowed me to learn with people from all walks of life. ","This summer, my friends and I wanted to learn how to create an NLP language model that would lower the barriers to financial literacy. We initially planned to work on one algorithm in our team of 8, but we ended up working so efficiently that we made a chatbot with almost every machine learning algorithm we researched. I worked on the backend ML algorithms that predicted similar matches and worked with the Team Lead to research and divide the tasks. Although our end product might have insinuated that we hit the ground running, our first week was a little rockier. In the beginning, it was difficult to identify everyone’s individual strengths and decide on a project especially since there are so many methods to increase financial literacy. It took about a week of experimentation to finally work out a system that worked for all our working styles. Something that I would do differently next time is be a little more diligent about asking people what they want to work on specifically, so that people don’t spend time tinkering on something they don’t have an interest in. ","Break Through Tech has proven to be my strongest support system for the past two years of college. It delivers only the best and when I feel that from an organization, I’m willing to give everything back. I’ve met other women in technology at Hunter College, but as I get into my upper level CS classes, they’re becoming increasingly rare. By participating in programs with Break Through Tech, I was given the opportunity to connect with women from other schools who have similar experiences and interests. In addition, I’m in a place in my college career where I can offer guidance to underclassmen. In my first experience with the winternship program, I met a girl who was confused about what she wanted to do because she had a rough first semester and I was able to relate to everything she said and tell her what resources I used and how I navigated that situation. My personal goal is to connect with more women in technology as well as apply what I’ve learned in an industry setting. ","Prior to my winternship, I was connected to the FAR Lab at Cornell Tech through WiTNY and continued working at the lab through the school semester. When I did my winternship at Citibank, I was able to apply the programming experience and presentation skills to my work at the lab. In addition, I’m working on a project with my friends right now to help increase food orders for independently owned restaurants. After a lot of discussion with the team, we decided on a chrome extension with chatbot components that would make the product more inclusive to those with limited hand dexterity. I did something similar at Citibank, so I was able to apply the thought process to this project. ","Technology so often feels like a space for only men and Break Through Tech works so hard to deconstruct that notion. My best experiences in technology have been facilitated by Break Through Tech, where I was able to meet women of all backgrounds. For example, I met a woman who was a practicing lawyer before she moved to the United States to pursue a degree in computer science and a young woman who grew up in NYC and didn’t know if she wanted to work in tech. I was able to learn so much about them and about myself from these encounters. For example, at my Citibank winternship, I was able to talk about my experiences as a first-gen low income student without any fear of judgement. In addition, I’m at a place in my college career where I can help underclassmen navigate through their own careers, so I was able to offer guidance to girls who felt just as lost as I was when I was in their shoes.

I was under the impression that the tech sector was inclusive. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized it was actually still a white male dominated field. It was off putting when my coworkers made jokes about my culture. Once I mentioned that it was scary walking in Manhattan in the evening, and a man in the room told me it was actually not scary at all and that the streets were very safe. It was strange to go from only working with women to being the only woman in the room at times.

This camera could make a 3D map of an object, even if there was a wall (or in this case a large piece of cardboard) that was obstructing the view. This camera worked by collecting and analyzing the patterns of light bouncing off the object and running the data through the code that would produce the map. As I looked at what was possible, what was being made I was amazed and all I could think was “wow, I need to be a part of that.”  The chance to create and be a part of the amazing projects like this one is what drives me to study computer science. I want to be a part of something new, something that can continue to inspire and spark the interest of others, as mine was sparked with the camera.

Using this, we hope to calculate the age of each star and its planets and in turn, whether or not a planet is unable to hone life or just too young and didn’t have time for life to form! I was always a team player. If I was ahead of my group members or I noticed them getting stuck somewhere, I always stopped to try and help the best I could. I've learned through doing this that the best way to help a peer is by helping them understand errors, instead of just telling them the right way to fix their specific problem. That way, they know how to solve the problem with other similar errors rather than just getting help this once. I also had problems myself which my peers helped me with, but its always beneficial to both parties, because sometimes explaining a solution could even help you understand the code more.

I am most excited about the new challenges that will occur as technology evolves. I enjoy problem solving, and love to learn the various ways to output the correct solution. With so many solutions that can arise, there will be an endless amount of possibilities and opportunities. I think the challenge and path to find the correct solution is what makes tech infatuating. When I have found a solution, I find it extremely rewarding to see all of my hard work unfold. Programming takes time to understand and implement, but being able to share with others what can be done in tech is a gratifying experience. Whether a project is big or small, I think it is inspiring what technology is now and what it will become.","This past summer I worked at Verizon for the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, with a group size of four interns. The goal of our work was to create an executive observability platform for leaders to view the reliability within their respective domains. First, I began working on back-end operations, which included updating the database, working on SQL queries, and APIs. Essentially, I helped automate the process of computing the reliability metrics for application, domain, and portfolio levels. In addition, I helped with the front-end by displaying the content onto the website for leaders to observe by using Angular and the chart.js library. I was able to collaborate with my team to create the observability platform and push our code to production. In addition to our project, we had weekly team-building events with our SRE team, which I was able to lead. The SRE team we had was big, so something I would do differently next time, is to reach out to more of our team members individually. Meeting with individuals will allow me to learn more about their role, perspective, and growth throughout the years.","The Winternship program is a great way to learn and explore a company. I constantly am eager to learn and think that the Winternship program fosters just that. My personal, academic, and professional goals for participating in the Winternship program is to learn and understand all of the concepts being taught around me. I want to be able to teach someone else what I worked on and how to successfully accomplish a project, as I believe that is the best way to know what I have learned. Through the participation of the Winternship, I want to meet new people and share ideas on how to improve projects. I want to apply the knowledge I have learned to future summer internships and jobs thereafter and make real world solutions. ","In my previous Winternship, I worked on an Alexa Skill for Verizon Wireless. This predominantly focused on working with node.js and back-end operations. When I first began the Winternship, I was unfamiliar with node.js, so I took the time to learn the fundamentals for this project. By learning these fundamentals, I was able to provide this back-end knowledge to my most recent summer internship with Verizon. I started with reviewing the code base the team I was joining already had, and challenged myself to incorporate SQL queries to the API files which included node.js. My Winternship experience in January 2020, was really impactful for me as I applied the node.js principles I learned to create a new project for my summer internship. ","I want to learn in this community and environment, because I have experienced the support and encouragement of Break Through Tech since summer 2018. A distinct memory I have is during Summer Guild 2018, where Judy Spitz took the time to teach a workshop. We built bracelets by connecting certain circuitry together. I have always admired the community Break Through Tech fosters which is learning, inclusivity, and support. I have gone to several events Break Through Tech has hosted not knowing anyone who was in the same room as me, but no matter the event, I was always comfortable to speak to other girls and mentors around.

Even though this isn’t an accurate depiction of what computer science is, these shows helped piqued my interest. Once I took my first coding class in sophomore year of high school, I realized I wanted to continue on this path even though it was nothing like any of the shows I had watched. As high school progressed, I took more and more coding classes such as robotics, intro to computer science, and AP computer science. When it came time to apply to college, I knew exactly what I wanted to pursue. To me, computer science has never been about inputting tedious code to receive an output like many perceive it as, but instead has offered me a chance to express and explore my creativity. I put in numerous hours of work into the projects that my teacher often assigned my classmates and I because I indulged in the creative freedom they bestowed. For example, for my robotics end of the year project, my teacher allowed us to create anything we wanted as long as we somehow incorporated the material that we learned during the school year. For that project, I decided to make a mini vending machine. The vending machine incorporated materials we had used for previous projects like LEDs, buttons, and DC motors but it also allowed me to attempt to utilize diverse applications that I was not accustomed to. Because of these projects, it was one of the most memorable classes I have ever had. What excited me about a career in tech the most is that there are endless possibilities of careers you could delve into. Although I knew I wanted to go into tech, I am still unsure of what exact field I want to aim towards. My current interests are information technology, cybersecurity and web development.  ","One of my most recent experiences working on a team was when I was an IT intern working at Hospital for Special Surgery through the Winternship program. I worked alongside four other interns. This was my favorite experience working on a team because although we were all from different backgrounds, we were able to connect with each other based on our aspirations and hobbies. As interns, our jobs were to automate scripts which would help the hospital with their quarterly system updates. Scripts are a list of steps on how to complete a task on the hospital’s system. One example of a script would be admitting a patient. Automating scripts were beneficial to the hospital because it meant that they didn’t have to manually check the new update for errors and bugs; the automated scripts would do it for them. By creating these automated scripts, it would cut down their testing time from two weeks to as little as three days. During the very first week, my coworkers and I familiarized ourselves with the coding language on Eggplant Functional: the software we were using to automate the scripts. During this process, I made sure to take notes of common lines of code we might end up using and the different methods we could use to code. The next step was adapting to the hospital’s system. Although we were given scripts that detailed the steps that we were supposed to take, they were too general for someone who had no experience with the system. During this process, we did our best to locate everything from the scripts like the tabs that needed to be clicked on to get to the next step. As I was doing this, I made sure to take notes and modify the script to make it more specific and easier to follow. We spent about a day or two adapting to the system. Once we completed these initial steps, we began coding. Since we only had two computers that had licenses to Eggplant Functional, we had to split up into teams. We split up into one group of two and one group of three while dividing the work accordingly. Whenever one group had trouble running the code or figuring out the mistake in the code, the other group would try to assist them. In the very beginning, we did not do this which caused us to waste a lot of time. We figured that it was more efficient by working all together when we ran into an issue because we were able to solve the problem faster. This was something I wish we did earlier on. During the coding process, my notes definitely came in handy when we forgot a certain line of code that we needed to use or when we forgot where something was located. Although coding was the most difficult part, we ended up finishing earlier than we expected so we continued to automate more scripts. Each script became easier and easier to do because we became acquainted to the hospital’s system and we became more knowledgeable of Eggplant Functional.","As someone who has only finished their freshman year of college, there is still a lot of time for me to learn and grow. So far, I have had one internship that related to my major which was working as an IT intern at a hospital. I thoroughly enjoyed the internship and it made me consider doing health IT in the future. Although I had my eyes set on doing health IT, one piece of advice that I was constantly told by superiors who worked at the hospital was to try everything. This was probably one of the most important pieces of advice I have ever received. I was reminded of the fact that I could accidentally stumble upon something I could enjoy more than what my current major is or reaffirm the idea that I was taking the right path by majoring in computer information systems and that is exactly what I want to accomplish by the end of the Winternship. My boss had told me that while he was an English major in college, he would have never thought that in a couple of years he would be working in a hospital’s IT department. To add on, the CIO of the hospital had majored in anthropology. She mentioned that she would have never foreseen that she would become the Chief Information Officer of a hospital. Not only do I hope that this Winternship will help reaffirm my choice in choosing to major in computer information systems or possibly help me discover a certain tech field I might like more, I hope to add on to my existing knowledge of coding by gaining a completely new experience and insight on something I have never done before.","During my Winternship, I learned mostly about robotic process automation. The way we used this knowledge during our Winternship was to create automated scripts that helped check for problems in the hospital’s system without anyone having to do anything besides clicking “run.” As of now, I am currently in the Summer Bridge Program held by SYEP. One of the projects we were doing was surprisingly familiar to what I did during the Winternship. The project involved creating a chatbot. You would send a message to the chatbot and the chatbot would send a reply back. Depending on what was inputted, it would give a certain answer. For example, if the person using the chatbot sent the words “Hi,” the chatbot would reply back, “Hi, what is your name?”. In order to do this, I had to code for the chatbot to recognize certain phrases; because of my prior experience through Winternship, I knew instantly how to execute the task. During my Winternship, my coworkers and I coded for the script to recognize certain images and words. If the code were to rush right into the next step without the page being loaded, the automated script would just crash. This is why we had to add lines of code for it to recognize words like “search” so we would know that the search bar had loaded, and it could continue onto the next line of code smoothly. Having done this before, it made it easier for me to understand why the chatbot needed those lines of code to recognize the words and thus, made the process more efficient. The coding language may not have been the same, but it was the same concept with a different application. ","Not only is it more congenial for all females to learn in this environment and community, but it is really important to me that women are more represented in tech careers. In my first computer science class I took in high school, there was an even ratio of male to female students. But as I took more of these classes in my high school career, I found that there was always fewer girls compared to the preceding year. By the time I was in senior year, I was the only girl amongst twenty-four other male students. I recall feeling faintly awkward, and I struggled to make any friends in that class. At the time, I wished there were other girls in the class that I could bond with or relate to. In an environment where I felt outnumbered as an outsider, I lacked confidence that I could do just as well. By participating in the Winternship, I feel that I can engage in intriguing projects that interest me and also contribute to fighting the stigma around the idea that women cannot fulfill careers as proficiently in the tech industry as compared to their male counterparts. I believe that in an encouraging and empowering community, women will feel more compelled to participate and thrive in a field that’s perceived to be dominated by males.",Yes,Elmhurst,New York,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,,,,Cai Ni Chen,Cai Ni Chen,0,2,No,No

My personal goal is to be able to work with other women that have the same interest as me, as I live in a household and neighborhood where women in computer science is something scarce. It would be nice to communicate with them as well as get any advice that they may have for me.

This is unfortunately the stigma that is in South Asian culture: women should take easy or famed career paths and have their husbands do all the hard and technical work. It would be a nice change of pace to be around people that may be going through the same thing that I am, and even if that is not the case, to be around people of the same career path is a blessing in and of itself. As aforementioned, I have a lot to learn and I would be ecstatic if I could learn whilst being alongside fellow women in tech.

I feel as though this lack of experience has already set me back in comparison to my peers and hurts my chances at career opportunities. In an effort to try to make up for this I spent and continue to spend my free time learning from online resources such as Udemy courses, videos, reading materials, and online communities that are focused around programming and information technology. In high school, I learned about CTF competitions and was able to encourage a few students in participating in the picoCTF competition at the time. Due to our school not offering established technical courses, our participation had to be outside of school, however I did later learn that one of those classmates decided to further develop their technical skills and pursue a career in information technology as a result. Over the years I continued and still continue to try my hand at these CTF competitions while self studying and I usually am able to make more and more progress in these events, proving to myself that I am slowly but surely getting better and more knowledgeable in various technical areas.   As for my college experience, I was undecided about whether I should pursue a medicinal field or the technical field which I had originally intended, and I believe that that indecisiveness further set me back as I have had to makeup that late start in my studies. I had to study throughout my entire 2019 summer in learning how to program in preparation for the Fall semester and was able to use what I learned to test out of an introductory programming course and move on to the next level courses. While this was great, I am still aware that I am behind my peers and continue to strive to learn as much as I can to better my skills. I have applied to a few IT and software engineering internship programs but I was denied each time either due to my student level or lack of documented experience and this always reminds me of how late I am to the party.

I believe that this program will help me find great research opportunities within the field of electrical engineering. This will also help in broadening my career options within the computer science or electrical engineering field. There are many great things being discovered within these fields such as innovative technology and methods. I have always had a keen interest towards online coding since I was 13. I've learned that a career in tech means improving the quality of life for many, whether that is through developing artificial intelligence, building new communication systems, or developing automation systems. As every year passes we see something new, the possibilities are endless. The technology industry is growing at a rapid pace and coders keep developing new software for the public to use. This software is also very diverse, they could be used to develop websites or create a platform to create personal videos. That is another thing I love about the technology you are not limited to one audience to create codes for. You can do absolutely anything with just knowing one language of code. I hope to be a part of this integral journey in the future of technology.","A time when I worked well on a team was my freshman year of college when my group and I built a clock. Along with the clock we had to create a virtual clock as well using various codes. We had 9-10 weeks to complete this as we met up once a week to complete the wiring of a circuit board. It was the first project of our college experience so all of us were pretty nervous and excited. But, 2-3 weeks in we got used to collaborating and working with each other side by side. My role in the group was to translate the instructions into regular words to let my partners know where to exactly put the wires and transmitters. There were many trial and error moments but we all worked together to figure out what went wrong and how to make the clock as efficient as possible. When the time came for the coding portion my other partner Lauren actually was very confident in her coding skills so she led us and gave us all roles to fulfill for our code for the clock. When in a group it is most important to communicate and learn from one another and I will always be appreciative of how cooperative my team was. What I would do differently next time, is take on more initiative in a leadership role to help guide my team better. We did have restraints because we had other classes to give our time to. But, if we had more time we definitely could have made the code more unique and interesting. Other than that, the team experience with my peers in the class was great and a memorable one.","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I had the wonderful opportunity of interning at IBM. Also, I know some peers at my college who talk highly about this program and the enriching experiences they have gained. As an Engineering major, it is difficult to come by such great opportunities to which the Winternship offers. My personal goals are to gain connections in my field. I would also like to improve my public speaking skills and continue having progressive and positive working habits. I want to keep learning through these new experiences given to me. When in a new environment. One of the things I experienced in my past internship is that you keep learning as you progress in life. An academic goal I have is I hope to gain a new skill and find peers who are in the same field as I am. Also, to continuously develop my complex problem-solving skills. A professional goal I have for participating in the Winternship program is to gain experience at a large company that can help pave the path for my future career and the future of technology. I hope my experience at the Winternship program will help me achieve all these goals and my future.","Yes, I have applied my skills and experiences from my previous Winternship to other academic opportunities. I have applied my Winternship skills to my past CS-related classes in the Spring of 2020. Also, in my engineering classes, I would work in teams and my experience at my last Winternship opportunity helped me become more collaborative. I was able to be more comfortable to speak up and discuss my thoughts about the project we were working on. In my classes, we had many CS projects to complete and team collaborative projects which helped me a lot since that is what my last Winternship experience was focused on.","Why I want to learn in this environment and community is because in computer science and technology-related fields there are not many women and people of color represented. At my time in my previous Winternship I was stationed at IBM, I was welcomed by Tamara Franklin and many other women in tech. It was really refreshing to see I was not the only one in this field, that gave me the motivation to keep pursuing my dream. Also, the group of interns I was assigned along with were so welcoming and nice. The community that the Winternship program provides is very genuine and helpful. Every intern I met was so nice and knowledgeable in their intended field. I hope to continue being involved with the Winternship program to keep having these amazing experiences and creating connections. ",Yes,New York City,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"At my college, there are a few women in my field. Every year I see more and more women being admitted into the same engineering school I am in. I have been in many classes where I am the only woman or there are a few women in a classroom. But, I still feel like America is still on a journey to have more diversity in the tech field. In my high school years, I was involved with GirlsWhoCode and did small workshops related to coding. I have so far learned about 4-5 languages of code my most recent ones are C++ and Matlab. My previous experience at the Winternship gave me a learning opportunity in how to work in a professional environment and learn some new coding skills.

The user would be able to create students, view the student, edit the student, and delete the student from a campus. For this project, I did the backend using ExpressJS and Sequelize. I did this by creating the models for the students and campuses, and creating an association for the two models using Sequelize. I also used ExpressJS to establish the proper routing to allow data to be read from the database when for example, the url would be: https://url/campus/id  would pull the student associated with the id that is a student of that campus.  The work can be viewed at: https://github.com/Wilfred0zz/CRUD-Campus-Students/pull/9/files I also used React.js to contribute to the front-end.

We also reiterated this by creating issues on GitHub and establishing a proper Git workflow that allowed us to clearly understand each others code and always had no conflicts when merging branches to the master branch of the repository.  I believe I did a good job in being an effective teammate by always communicating with them and through using GitHub, however, for next time, although I did write my issues in detail on GitHub, I could write the issues in more detail to make it more clear what changes I made to the code, allowing for my teammates to adapt more easily when viewing the changes I have made.

","As I have not had much prior experience with group projects in Computer Science, I wish to discuss the first time I participated in anything serious: the CUNY 2020 Hackathon. Our team was primarily concerned with a digital kiosk, which would provide ample information concerning different attractions located nearby based on price and distance. I did not know much, but I nevertheless was wholly accepted by my more experienced teammates. While I did not do anything too hands-on, I became more useful than I initially thought. I freely suggested possible functions and packages to implement, facilitating the overall development of the project; to say the least, I learnt quite a bit on parsing through documentation. Additionally, examining my teammates code allowed me to learn a lot about project design and organization. As I am now a bit more experienced with Computer Science, I would like to get a bit more hands-on in development.    ","Aside from expanding my portfolio in Computer-Science related endeavors, I wish to genuinely hone my developmental skills. Every hour you participate in something like this feels like a week of attending a class in Computer Science. These sorts of experiences foster so much creativity and development. As a rising sophomore, every bit of experience is fantastic!",,"Frankly, a more diverse background is refreshing, and in my experience, more inclusive. As a Jew, many would generally group me with the more privileged upper-class, but I simply never belonged to those spheres. I grew up attending shoddiest private schools which focused primarily on religious studies -- heavily neglecting general studies. I just feel more at home in these sorts of settings. Additionally, it just allows me to widen my perspective. I was appalled when I first discovered that there were female-only events due to sexual harassment. It is disturbing that something like this is necessary.

","I've always worked well on a team throughout my life, whether it be in sports, academic, or professional settings. One occasion that comes to mind was when I was serving in the Korean Air Force. I was assigned a task to select a team of eight soldiers to clear out a whole mountainside full of mines left from the Korean War in order to expand our landing space. Being the squad leader, I first handpicked the men who would be the best fit for the task and efficiently assign roles in order to complete the task in the allotted time frame.

I really enjoy that specific aspect of the industry because I think that there is always something to be learned from collaborating with other people who may think or work differently from you. What excites me is being able to constantly learn from my peers since there is always something new to be discovered in an industry that is constantly changing and becoming increasingly advanced as time passes. Additionally, the vast reach of technology is inspiring, and there are so many opportunities to choose from. You will always have the option to try something new and work with different teams of people in the industry, so you are never forced to stick to one role and are given the chances to expand your knowledge and experience. ","I worked well in a team of four other women during my time at Verizon Network Engineering and Operations for my first Winternship experience with BTT. Our mission as a group was to build an effective solution in order to plan a structured 5G fiber network in a specific market (we chose the city of Cleveland as a model). As a team, we worked to solve for better visibility of data, which meant to organize the data collected by Verizon in a way that would be more accessible and easy to follow. As a group, we had to decide on a solution that would close these gaps in the Network build plan by analyzing the data that was provided to us by Verizon.  My contribution to the team was the first part of our solution. It was a “Priority Analysis” where all the priorities for a specific market (city) would be presented in a way that would allow users to determine what aspect of the fiber network build was more critical within that market. The goal of the Priority Analysis was to focus on 5G sites using segments of fiber, called FQNiDs. The four main priorities listed in this analysis were “Nodes per mile built”, which determined what fiber route connected to the most 5G nodes in order to deliver wireless 5G service to customers. Backhaul cables: which were important because without them, 5G service cannot be delivered. Distance from existing fiber: which determined which 5G nodes (antennas) were closest to fiber routes already in existence. Finally: “Clustering”, which helped prioritize a specific area within a market that would benefit most from building additional fiber routes in order to connect the larger number of 5G nodes that were clustered in the area.  My role in this project was the data collector and listener. I was responsible for researching how fiber works and the logistics behind a fiber build plan at Verizon. I was able to obtain all the information I needed for the project through online research and through interviewing Verizon employees who were very experienced in their roles. Additionally, as a listener I was able to hear the ideas of everyone in the group and take note of what was suggested. Then at the end of the discussion, the team would go through all the notes I had taken and together would rule out what would be the most important task to focus on considering the time limit that we had and what we wanted to concentrate on for our final project. I was supportive of everyone on the team, as they were to me, and I suggested that our final solution should be in two parts which was the Priority Analysis and a tagging tool/app we idealized called “Insite” that would identify fiber route gaps using FQNiDs. This app would state why a specific fiber route was not being built, in a way that was organized and accessible to everyone in the company. One thing I would do differently is to never let my own self doubt or imposter syndrome get to my head and start to believe the compliments given to me by my teammates and project managers. I am learning to believe in my own abilities and I think I will be a better version of myself when I stop overly criticizing my own work. ","Although I have grown so much in terms of my technical skill compared to just last year, I know for a fact there is still so much more I have to learn and experience in order to be ready to enter the tech industry in the near future. Academically, I want to always be sharpening my coding skills and always allow myself to “think outside the box”, which to me means to work smarter, not harder, and to be creative. For my personal goals, I want to meet new individuals from the tech industry since I have learned that no one's path to their career is the same as another person’s and in my experience, these professionals have always been willing to give me advice and support when I asked. For my professional goals, I want to be exposed to the different roles and positions there are within a tech company and to learn what those responsibilities are, since I am very early in my academic career and learning about these different roles will help me understand where I want to take my own career in the future. This Winternship program will allow me to accomplish so much in just one month and it will allow me to grow both academically and professionally.","In my previous Winternship, I learned to never be afraid to ask my peers whatever questions I may have. It was nerve racking for me at first to ask my project managers at Verizon for any help that I needed because I did not want them to think that I was not fit for the job. However, I quickly came to the realization that people are always willing to help you if you ask them and it is always better to ask, rather than staying stuck for a longer period of time. When I was unsure about how to debug a student’s code when I was a TA for Upperline, I made sure to quickly ask another teacher or co-TA for help, because that way it would allow the student to work on the rest of the lab more effectively. It also allowed me to figure out the problem and be able to help other students who may have the same issue come up later on. Furthermore, I learned from my time at my Winternship that it is best to complete one aspect of your project at a time instead of starting multiple things at once. This saved me time and I found I was less stressed as well. This applied to my TA job because I helped students become better at deciding how much they could code in the time allotted for their final projects since some students wanted to code multiple things at once, instead of coding one part of their web pages first and making sure their webpage is functional at every step.","Every single experience I have had with BTT since the very beginning of BTT Summer Guild of 2019, the interactions I had with my teachers, supervisors, peers, and team managers allowed me to realize how important it is to have responsible, welcoming, and informed individuals who will inspire a new generation of female students to pursue careers in Computer Science and Technology. More recently, the positive interactions I had with the teachers I worked with as an Upperline Code TA helped me realize that, as important as it is to be a talented programmer in the tech industry, creating new connections and finding people who you can trust, collaborate with, and learn from is what makes you a well rounded individual. This is why I will always cherish the community that is created in an environment that supports women from all races, ethnicities, and sexualities across the spectrum because I know this is a space where I am welcome, supported and pushed to be a better version of myself. In these spaces I am able to learn without judgement and encouraged to learn from my mistakes rather than shunned for them. These spaces are necessary and I am forever grateful for BTT for making it their mission to provide young women in the computer science and tech field with these communities of support.

I am often overwhelmed at the patience I have for learning related concepts. Keeping track of time often becomes difficult and every new activity brings its own challenge and the satisfaction of conquering it. I believe with my skill set, I will not only be able to complete a project in time, but also develop some insightful views. The tech industry is continuously expanding at an exponential rate. This expansion has led to a rapid increase in the number of roles. The vast variety of fields, and mobility of being able to explore, navigate and grow through them as well as being able to not only keep up but also contribute to the growth of this ever-evolving industry excites me about having a career in tech. ","In Winternship 2019 I worked in a team of three as a developer at Morgan Stanley for a period of three weeks. Our project was to write code for a chatbot to ease the navigation process. Employees faced difficulty while attempting to access databases being unaware of whether they had permission to access them and whom to contact to gain the required permission. To resolve this problem and simplify the process of accessing databases we built a chatbot using Natural Language Processing. I had some prior experience with chatbot development so I mostly contributed to the mainframe coding of the chatbot, whilst helping in implementing NLP in our model. If asked to look back and do something different, I would urge my teammates to spend some more time planning the process on paper so cross-platform ideas can be exchanged and we could reduce the cyclic work of understanding other people's code and modifying our code accordingly.  ","I wish to participate in Winternship 2020 so that I am able to interact with like minded people and find friends with similar career driving objectives. Although college is a great place for personal and professional development, it is also a ground for diversity. I believe that the Winternship opportunity would help me progress in a specialised field of tech. It is a widespread notion that nowadays to excel in one’s career, one must possess a certain specialised skill set. My major in computer science, mathematics, and quantitative economics ensures I have the theoretical background, however, the Winternship would fortify my concepts by providing a practical application.","In my previous Winternship I gained skills in Python programming and learnt about computer vision during a workshop. I continued to learn and work with Python after the completion of this internship and came across OpenCV, which is a library that can be used for real time computer vision. Using this I built a program for recognizing American Sign Language using the background removal model of OpenCV. I also wrote the code to a program that would identify different parts of the face using haar cascades. My work was chosen to be presented at the Queens College Tech Incubator Open House. Additionally, I also worked with Java during my Winternship which tremendously helped me when I took OOP in Java in my college, as I was much more confident and familiar with the concepts upon taking the class. Through my Winternship I was also able to meet Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++ which was also very inspiring to me as someone still in the early stages of my tech journey. The experience and confidence I gained after the completion of my Winternship motivated me to start a robotics club at my college so I could continue my passion for robotics. ","I wish to learn in the environment nurtured by Winternship and the community of people who have gained from this internship opportunity because I believe this would help me meet people with similar backgrounds, who have worked and practised on their own. When I started my career in tech, I had virtually no help from my kins and peers. I can still recall the urge to learn but the bottlenecks I faced because I was unable to clear a minor doubt. I remember feeling if only I had someone to consult just for a few minutes, how it would save me several hours. Working with people who have been through the same process would help me connect with them on a personal level and even gain valuable advice on how they managed the pressure of learning a new skill on their own. In the tech industry, I am certain to face new challenges which I must conquer on my own, however, the Winternship opportunity would help me build a network of peers who can help me solve a problem quicker and manage a problem better.

There are many different types of tech careers out there. When I thought about the tech field, I always thought of it as a difficult field, that it was a field that I could not do, coding looked like a very hard language to learn at the time. I started learning about the coding language about 2 years about, and so many thig surprised me, I thought there was only one type of career within the tech field. It's interesting how almost everything we do every day has to do with technology, from what wakes us up, the shower we take, how we warm our food or make it, and from getting to a place or another. Everything we do have to do with technology, and it gets advance ever single day, and being able to learn how everything comes to play makes me really excited to learn more about it. ","A time that I worked with a team is the winternship 2020 that past, I was in a team of five, and we had to work on a new coding language in order to create a program for the company to help the employes in the hospital making it easy to make appointments for its patients, and for doctors to schedule surgery easily for the patients. At first, the programming language was really hard to learn and to apply it to the project we were working through. My other teammates were really helpful in helping me learn the coding language, we had three weeks of this internship, and at the end, we had to perform a project provided by the company. This means that if we are using a language that I have not learned yet, I had about a week to learn the language, and the other week to work on the project with my teammates and I, and the third week to prepare with my teammates and mentors to prepare for the project that we'll be presenting. Overall, it was so great to work with teammates who are in college and can offer advice with one another, and help one other. We had many different parts to work on in the project, and so we all had different roles to play For the first part all of us worked together so that we can get familiar with the program, and how we are going to do the project that we are given, and the second part me and a partner worked on it, will the other part, my other three teammates worked on it, and after each of us did our part, we came together to put it into one. ","I want to participate in the Winternship because it's the first internship that I did that help me to learn skills that I would not have learned anywhere else. I never thought that one of the skills that I would have in life would be coding, and in over six months I was able to learn many different types of coding as a beginner. Participating in the summer guild introduced me to three coding programmers that I have never learned, and was able to build a website with that skill, in the 2020 winternship that I did at HSS the hospital, I learned another language that helped me and my team build a special program for the IT department.  I want to major in Biomedical Engineering and minor in computer science, as a person who wants to go into the medical field, coding would be a skill that would come in hanging. Learning about the subject of biomedical Engineering can get you so far, but understanding the languages in the commuter can help me get further into my academics. ","Unfortunately, I have not been involved in CS-related activities, due to the number of seats provided in my computer science classes, I have not been able to enroll in computer science 1. However, since my previous winternship with learning the Eggplant Function Program, the coding language that is used in the function is SenseTalk. During the free time that I have, I have been trying to strengthen my coding skills of the language, though the weeks of the winternship were short, I tried to learn more about strength my skills, by watching videos and doing some practice of my own. It was hard without a mentor, but I was able to do more practice of my own. Teaching my self is going to come in really hanged mostly well in college because well we do have professors, students are the ones that need to study for the materials provided, it's the same way with coding. ","Women are at a disadvantage when it comes to so many things. In the technology field women make up about 20% of it, and that is nothing, it's up to us the generation now to increase the low number to a higher one whether it's' 10 or 20 years from now. Learning technology is such a good tool to have in the future because it's the most advanced and wanted job right, and probably in the future. Women who are going into the technology field need the help and support of other women who are also interested in the same thing so that they can help each other, and by learning things that they would not know if there wasn't a team to work on. I want to learn from this environment and community because it's a safe and diverse place where I can feel safe, and gain opptunities into the tech workforce.

While my friend worked on a code- based project, I was able to walk around, explore, and spend some time watching a film about accessibility and technology, which is something that I hope to learn about in my own future endeavors.",No,No,"I did not feel confident or skilled enough to apply,Other, please specify:","Several opportunities had restrictions (such as age, being able to travel far) that prevented me for either application, participation, or both.  I did not have much prior knowledge in computers and tech, and did not hear about many other opportunities.",,,,,"          A career in tech would mean pursuing something that interests me.  More importantly, a career in tech would mean watching doors that had been closed and locked begin to open.  I would be able to begin looking to my future with more hope and less fear.  A stable career with many possibilities is extremely exciting; a career in tech can open doors that lead to relocation, remote work, and networking with amazing people with similar interests.  Having grown up with few opportunities to learn about tech, I have a huge desire to learn now.  There is always something new, and it is quite exciting to think that there will be more innovations throughout my lifetime.                      I believe that a successful person not only rises despite obstacles, but also pulls others up with them.  I would not consider myself a truly successful person unless I can use my position to empower others.  I have found it difficult to navigate the health care system and to advocate for myself in the past, as I have spent a lot of time going between doctors and specialists.  Because of this personal connection, I would like to help as many people as I can in my future career; I can use tech to help people by working with/on accessibility features.  I would love to use the skills I learn to get involved in health-based software and am particularly interested in being involved with software that helps the disabled community and other marginalized groups.  I am very excited to do my best to help my city and its’ most vulnerable populations thrive.                      My own interest in computers and tech came at a later age because I did not have access to tech at a young age, nor was I encouraged to pursue such fields.  I am excited to become successful enough that I can offer resources and experiences to help those underrepresented in tech to be propelled forward in their careers as well.  For example, I have learned in previous coursework that while males who enter female- dominated fields are often met with open arms, females who enter male- dominated fields face struggles and backlash, even from peers and co-workers.  I would want to help others to break “glass ceilings” by ensuring that other women are encouraged to pursue their passions and are not discriminated against in education and the workplace.  If I can become a woman in tech, I can be an influencer and leader within the industry.  ","           When I first began looking for internships required for a class, I was apprehensive when a professor suggested that I intern at the Men’s Resource Center of Kingsborough Community College (run though the CUNY Black Male Initiative).  I wondered if I, female, would have a difficult time fitting in with other staff and having meaningful conversations with students, at a center where the target demographic is men of color.  I wondered if I would be able to make an impact if I were viewed as an outsider.  As I befriended some of the staff and students, I had the opportunity to share ideas and connect.  Working together with students who utilize the services, and student-staff, I was able to bridge the gap in experiences and foster connections between students and resources that they need and help facilitate connections with and between students and outside faculty.  As time passed, I found more ways to engage students in a way where they felt that I could empathize or understand their experiences, and where we could find shared experiences that connected us.                       I was overjoyed when students wanted to stay after the programs were finished to keep the dialogue going.  I believe that though I was hosting the discussions by having presentations and information to begin the dialogue, every discussion was a team effort between myself and the students attending.  There was a very interesting dynamic within the groups because some of the topics that we spoke about are not things that we discuss with our families.  Some people had varying opinions, but we usually found a way to hear what every other person had to say.  I was able to serve as a mediator and facilitator of discussion.                      Throughout this time, I also collaborated with other staff members as well as organizations and clubs on campus.  While I enjoyed doing presentations and discussions on my own, working collaboratively as a team brought in more opinions and discussion topics.  I worked with members of the Community Health Club on workshops for the semester including a presentation about Image and Self Love.  I frequently helped conduct collaborative workshops for the “Mental Health Mondays” programming that the Men’s Resource Center began to host.  One bigger challenge was working on a collaborative panel event called “Through your phone: A discussion about human interaction.”  Due to personal reasons, I was uncomfortable with being onstage throughout the duration of the event.  At first, this caused a bit of tension with one of the directors of the panel, but I was able to talk to him about other ways that I can help coordinate and participate.  I helped with ideas and with background research, created a series of questions for audience participation, and asked the audience questions during the interactive portion of the presentation.  I was happy to keep people engaged, and to hear information being used in the panel itself that I had curated.                      	   I was able to overcome the initial obstacle of finding common ground, and catalyze discussion and change.  I have a background working with many diverse people and can perform well in group settings, but I realize that every group and every team is different.  Sometimes it is more difficult to find a common ground than at other times.  I enjoy being the person who brings other people together in a team effort. ","          I would like to acquire new technical skills necessary for a career.  The practical skills that I can take away from the experience would help me anywhere I go in life.  Experiences such as internships can be a defining moment in a persons’ career.                      A huge reason that I would like to be able to participate in this immersive program is that without knowing people in the field, it can be difficult to obtain employment at that first job in tech.  It is undeniable that it would be amazing to be able to connect with others who have the same interests as me, to experience work in the tech industry, and to connect with people from whom I can learn.  I would like to meet people who are able to offer mentorship or advice for me while I embark on this journey.  I am interested in improving my networking skills and will reach out to people in the tech field, especially people from other marginalized groups who have been able to pursue such careers.  It is important to find relationships within the tech field because nobody works alone.                       This Winternship would also give me a peek into the world of tech as an employee, rather than as an outsider.  I am hoping that as I continue to learn and eventually when I seek a position full- time, that I will not feel any form of “imposter syndrome.”  I think that having experience like this before continuing would help me to feel like I belong, even with any barriers that may arise along the way. ",,"          I would like to learn in this environment and community because I want to feel welcomed in the often male- dominated world of tech.  When I was growing up, my female peers and myself were not encouraged to learn about tech, and were instead pushed towards the arts and humanities.  I think that a program like this would connect me with people who not only have similar goals, but may share some similar past experiences. As there are many programs both in tech training and career development with age ceilings, I am often ineligible to apply.  In addition, your mission speaks to me because I am also a part of several other groups that are underrepresented in the tech field.  As an advocate for equality and opportunity for all, I like the idea of being inclusive to everyone.                My family brought me to this country as refugees, being religious minorities (which we are here in the U.S.A. as well).  As new immigrants, we did not know about many of the opportunities that others may have known about.  My family always struggled with finances, the stress of which impacted me greatly, in addition to being unable to participate in activities due to lack of funding.  I was not granted the same opportunities as my peers who had technology within reach in their personal lives at a younger age.  Even in college, I was unable to sign up for some courses that required a lot of prior knowledge or a computer to be brought to class because, due to finances, I had shared a device with others in my household. I am a first-generation student; it had been a dream of my parents that I become the first in my family to take Bachelors’ Level coursework.  I had to work very hard to succeed in school. I struggled with ADHD, which went undiagnosed until recently, and never received the help that I needed.                        The biggest obstacle for me, academically, socially, and in general life, has been that chronic health issues prevented me from being able to save money, take educational opportunities, and even take some job opportunities.  I feel as though such an inclusive environment would allow me to learn and grow, especially now that the Winternship opportunities will be remote. ",Yes,Brooklyn,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,Yes,,Yes,"I am currently in the CUNY Techworks UX Design Program.  By the time the Winternship program begins, I will have learned about will design and layout concepts, user interface aesthetics, and multimedia integration, along with the inclusion of some programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  This program includes project-based learning that I think would be a good preparation for an internship. I hope that what I learn this year can be applied during a Winternship and that I can benefit from career development assistance.  In the past, I have found it very difficult to find opportunities in tech.  I believe that my inclusion in the tech sector can help to make tech more diverse and inclusive.  I would be very grateful for the opportunity.",,,Inessa Royt,Inessa Royt,0,2,No,No

",No,Yes,,,,,,,A career in tech excites me because technology is a passion of mine. I enjoy learning about technology and creating new things. I believe through technology we can create a huge impact on society and a career in tech would give me the opportunity to do so.,"I am very passionate about providing solutions to environmental issues, particularly global warming and climate change. The recent Australian fires, earthquakes in Guayanilla, and Puerto Rico, the increase in sea pollution, as well as the drastic weather changes in many parts of the world, are evidence that more attention should be brought to environmental issues.  For most of it, the government and individuals are currently focused on providing remedies to the damages made. To help the problems of global warming and climate change, first, I am educating myself on these issues and participating in opportunities that allow me to network with people who are also passionate about this issue. Most importantly and practically, I am using less plastic and recycling more to set an example for others in my community.  Last summer, I participated in the summer guild program, where I learned coding and website design. With the new knowledge, in a team of three, we created a website about global warming and climate change, which provides information and statistics from all around the world. I helped gather information about the topic and worked on the layout of the website. If I could do something different next time it would be time management. We were not able to finish everything we wanted on the website because of the short span of time. If we had another opportunity, we would assign different tasks to all team members in order to save time.","I want to participate in the Winternship program because this Winternship will give me the opportunity to apply the skill I have learned from college to real-life situations. My personal goal for participating in the Winternship program is to learn more about the tech industry, improve my tech-related skills, and learn from the team members. My professional goal for participating in the Winternship program is to gain experience which would be helpful for future opportunities.",,"As a first-generation college student and a woman of color pursuing Computer Science at Bronx Community College, it has been challenging to find role models whom I can emulate in my field of interest. To catch up with this motivation-gap, I have done activities and gained values that will help me succeed in the tech industry and become an asset to the WiTNY community.  From 2016 to 2019, I was a scholar in the National Honors Society, where I did 40 hours of community service annually, during which I assisted with preparations and cleaning for events, blood drive in the community, teaching middle school students, and more. I participated in the Summer Guild Program, where I learned and practiced coding and website designing. Also, I have participated in The Bank of America Ignite with Tech Program where learned about unique culture and vast history at Bank of America.  I grew up and spent most of my life in Pakistan, where I hardly remember seeing females work in the tech industry. Not having people like me that I could look up to make it difficult to dream of working in the field. Coming to the United States to be educated gave me the first hope, which I know the  WiTNY's resources and holistic support can solidify to attain my career goals. While navigating the tech industry, first through education and community participation, I am interested in the opportunity of the Winternship program.

It is like Sci-Fi come to life! To make the world a better and safer place using technology is awesome!  Finally, tech's versatility is exciting. I can choose where to apply my skills, whether it is at a non-profit or a company like Warby Parker. Or whether I want work in the U.S. or in the UK. Being tech savvy gives me the freedom to apply my skills in places that align with my likes/values. There truly is a global effort across businesses to utilize tech and analyze data, that its applications are seemingly endless!","This summer, I got to create a website with a team, doing basic web development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal was to create a visually pleasing and user-friendly site that informs citizens of neighborhood cleanups.  I focused on creating the website's navigation tools and details, like hyper-link buttons and a search filter. I took the role of inputting data, such as dates and addresses, along with a creating a story page  to allow the users to connect with our mission. I also delegated responsibilities to my team members, like one of us would be in charge of designing the visual aesthetics of the website.  In the end, I realized how important it is to create a visually appealing website, rather than just focusing on the small details like text and hyperlinks.   Next time, I would organize us into an assembly line to become quicker and more efficient. One person would code in the skeleton, another would put in the details, and the other would review/tweak the code. This would make the process more collaborative, instead of each person focusing on just one part by themselves. I would also prioritize the visual aspects, or the big foundation of the site, as opposed to the smaller details like creating hyperlinks. This would allow us to prioritize the user and their experience, rather than trying to create a complex website that is above our knowledge of coding. ","As a student in the Winternship program, I want to build my confidence in pursuing a career in tech. Many times I have found myself intimidated by the world and path of tech, the amount of math and skill that goes into it, that makes it scary but exciting. It's exciting to know that I have a challenge and with hard work and persistence it is possible to achieve it.  I am currently interested in pursuing a career as a data analyst, because it utilizes statistical methods to make better decisions, and can be used for the good of society (for example, its application in nonprofits, the environmental sector, etc). I am also interested in the field of IT and the career path of IT consulting. This Winternship would give me the right exposure inside these fields of problem-solving and collaborative teamwork.  Whichever path I choose, whether it is being a data analyst, or an IT consultant, I want to solve problems, be part of an exciting, advancing field, and make an impact on the world. It is my personal goal to accomplish what I believe to be challenging, and to be part of a community of hardworking, like-minded people. ",,"By learning in this environment, I know that I am supported and that opportunities exist. With the community of Break Through Tech alumni, I have the resources and support of previous mentors to succeed. I know that there are people I can contact, if I ever need the help advancing forward.  Being in this community, I know that I am not alone. I know that there are girls who aren't afraid of a  challenge, want to achieve greatness, and value hard work. To me, it is important to surround myself with intelligent and supportive people, because it inspires me to continue on this path and make great friends who are going through similar, if not the same, circumstances.   That is why I choose this program! ",Yes,Bronx,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"Personally, whenever I've looked for CS opportunities on campus or met CS majors, I have only encountered males who have a natural proficiency in mathematics. I have also looked up information online about various tech careers, and most experts are males who are white or of Asian descent. This has made me feel immensely underrepresented as a Latina female who has not been able to connect myself to tech opportunities, without the help of programs like Break Through Tech, especially as a first-generation American and being from New York City's poorest borough.  I have participated in Break Through Tech's Summer Guild, where I coded a website with a team in CSS and Javascript. I also have strong analytical skills from the anthropology and philosophy courses that I have taken.

My professional goal is to build my network by befriending new people at whatever company I work for in January. ,"Since my previous Winternship, I have interviewed for various roles as an intern. I used the skills I learned in my winternship like professional presentation and how to discuss professional history to present myself eloquently. WiTNY has also provided me with a vast wealth of experience that I could put on my resume. I participated in a mentorship program from Credit Suisse and learned a lot about them. I eventually even landed a role as a summer interm there thanks to WiTNY. ","I want to learn in this environment and community because prior to being a part of WiTNY, I wasn't even aware that I would be able to pursue computer science as a woman. I feel that WiTNY's emphasis on underrepresented women is really empowering and it awoke this drive in me to spread messages of equality and equity to whoever will listen.

We made a collaborative PDF annotator using WebSockets so you could edit PDFs simultaneously with others. We’re pretty used to making webapps but we put it on Heroku instead of running our own server. Users are able to use a “marker” or “highlighter” of various sizes and any hex color to edit PDFs, and erase their markings. They’re also able to add other users as readers or editors.   I also participated in the DuckieTown Workshop at Hunter, which was an autonomous navigation workshop funded by the Google Research exploreCSR Program. It was a week long workshop that focused on using image capture to navigate Duckiebots, which are basically just rubber duckies strapped to a mini autonomous car! We worked in teams and worked on being able to remotely control them, then learned a bit more about path finding and artificial intelligence. We then focused on image processing as a means of controlling them, and tried to get simplified lane following working so they could navigate a small scaled down city track. We also worked on getting them to start and stop based off the colors of parts of the paths and going through tunnels successfully.   I also code in my free time! I tend to dabble in a few projects at a time, but one project I've been working on pretty intermittently is a Python script that chooses classes that fulfill a specified number of requirements, hardness (in terms of class level), and whether or not they're a writing intensive class. It also scrapes the course directory to get the names of courses, descriptions, and their individual links to their pages in the directory.  ",Yes,,,,F_2ze7YLfDZtCTXre,rachel_ng_resume.pdf,68061,application/pdf,"Coding is one of the few things I find myself able to easily concentrate on. I find myself constantly falling down rabbit holes and finding new, interesting things to look into and learn at every turn. I think I’m most excited about a career in tech because it’s constantly changing and there are new things and new opportunities for me to learn all the time. I also really enjoy the prospect of solving problems for the rest of my life, whether it’s as a software engineer or as someone higher up who’s designing the solutions in a couple of years. ","I worked with 2 other interns during my internship this past summer! We worked on a fairly large project where we created CI/CD Jenkins jobs for a library of plugins, created tests based off of an older test suite, and provided production level monitoring by integrating the monitoring platform used within the firm.  We distributed the work of creating the jobs and tests equally amongst ourselves and we all played an equal role in that. We helped each other out a lot whenever we ran into issues, whether they were module version issues or difficulty understanding the test suite we were basing our tests off of. I helped out with the module version issues (which were fairly prolific and time consuming, especially considering most of the issues were specific to our company) and general issues that needed searching the most as I was the best at combing through the rather internal search results.  I coded the function for sending events and some helper functions, and the CLI we used to send events from bash scripts. While I integrated the monitoring for the majority of the plugins myself, I also showed my teammates how to integrate the monitoring for some of the plugins they were actively working on. The main reason why I was able to work so well within this team was because of the ease of working with my amazing teammates. There isn’t much I would do differently next time considering we all made an effort to help each other out when we were stuck, pair (well, group) programmed when we were working through new concepts, technologies, and issues we encountered, and generally communicated well with each other.  The only thing I’d change would be working together in an actual office, as working remotely did impede our communication a bit considering that we largely talked over instant messages (IM) and weren’t able to communicate things as clearly as we would’ve in person. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I’d really like to gain exposure to working in technology and see what a career in it has to offer, especially at different companies! I feel that I’m still very unclear as to what I want to do and I’d love an opportunity to explore other career paths that exist within this realm.  I really like that Winterns get to learn more about the company they work at and how it operates, and learn about other roles within the business because I’d really like a broader view of jobs within the industry and to see how they come together. My work experience has largely been as a software engineer and has largely been limited to a single company and I’d really like to see what else is out there. I feel that doing a Winternship would be a great opportunity for me to discover other companies and other aspects of the field I haven’t had much exposure to. I feel like the career development workshops would also be really helpful and I’d really enjoy having the opportunity to work with my peers on a project and develop my presentation skills and soft skills. ",,"I think that a Winternship is a great opportunity to learn from and work with people I can relate to, because I might not get one again for a long time. As an individual, I don’t necessarily feel purposefully excluded in tech spaces, but that doesn’t mean that I feel particularly included. I feel like my subconscious feelings as an outsider stem from a lack of people I can see myself within. Learning within an environment and community that seeks to be safe and inclusive for people like me would allow me to feel a sense of belonging and feel less pressure to conform to some arbitrary status quo that I can’t necessarily picture myself as. I feel that diverse environments make for a more open collective mindset, and allows people to ask questions they might normally hesitate to ask and fosters discussion of topics we might not even broach elsewhere. I think this environment and community would allow me to focus more on learning and developing my skills, and that it’d make for a great experience overall.

That way, every week we can skip review more often and move on to the next subject right away with no hassle. My co-workers also pitched in and offered to purchase new workbooks that would suit well to the plan.

In our research, I find out a lot of things that could help astronauts. Also in our future. It could improve our lives. And we might not get older quickly as human nature does. Also, my thought gets help from Harvard medical school professor David Andrew Sinclair. I mainly talked about the human aging process and why it happens. Also, what is responsible for our DNA damage. However we didn’t get the place in competition but we got highest grade on class for that interesting research. ","I have done so many internship and those was related to the technology field. I want to pursue my career in technology field. Since the winternship related to the tech, it looks fascinating for me. I love to work related to tech.

Simultaneously, our team was also competing for seed funding in the Zahn Innovation Startup Competition. Throughout the whole process of starting this startup, my team and I ran into a couple of challenges along the way. Initially, we had a few major disagreements regarding how we envisioned the product, and this really delayed product development. However, we eventually learned ways to handle disagreements like these, including making pros/cons lists for our ideas, and going into discussions with an open mind. I wish that we had utilized these conflict resolution strategies a bit earlier, but am glad that we finally did end up using them. Ultimately, we ended up launched our app to the App Store last April and won 1st place in the Zahn competition ($35k in seed funding).

Growing up I was always curious as to how exactly people created these popular things that managed to be a major part of people’s lives. So ever since I was young I always had an interest in being a part of the technology field, but over time it became less about the hardware and more about the software that anyone can create with a simple laptop. With programming it allows anyone to make an impact whether it be big or small in their respective fields, and that is what I find to be the beauty of the technology field. My career goals are to obtain a job/internship in a modern tech company whether it be a well established company like Google and Facebook or a recent startup like Coinbase and Airbnb, and once I’m in said companies, I want to have meaningful impact toward the company. Like most industries, in the computer science, you’ll find more often than not, that in order to obtain work experience (i.e. internships) you’ll need experience or something to showcase that you have potential. I feel that the languages and technologies taught in this program will alone for the internship and job search process to be a lot smoother and more streamlined. In addition to the technologies that will be taught the career mentorship that will be provided will be immensely helpful in learning from people already well established in the tech industry. The tech field is always trying to make the next big thing, and being a part of that change is something I want in a career, which is one of the many things that excites me about a career in tech. ","One of the biggest accomplishments that I’ve achieved was getting 1st place at a Google CodeNext hackathon. During this hackathon I partnered together with 3 other random individuals and together we had to take on the challenge of making anything using tech that could benefit people’s health. The goal of the team was to make an app or product that would benifit people's health. I presented the idea to the team to make a mobile app that allows one to take photos of any food and the app would then return the nutritional information. The intention of the app was to make people think twice about what they consume by displaying the nutritional information, and hopefully after seeing the information it encourages them to make more healthy eating choices. To make this app we had to take on the challenge of learning how to implement an API(Google Cloud Vision API), into our app given the short period of time we had at the hackathon. This achievement/experience that I had during this hackathon, has helped me improve a lot of transferable skills that will help me thrive in this program. For example being able to successfully work with new people is immensely important for any project and is an important skill to have as a professional. Also I was able to take the leadership role in the team and despite the high stress of the fast approaching deadline, I was able to help lead the direction in which our app went by presenting a creative idea that no other team thought of doing. Together with the team we were able to not only successfully produce a working app but also present it to everyone in a meaningful and articulate way. It's one thing to make a good product but having the skills to present it is just as important. What I would do differently next time, is probably assign more concrete rolls to each member instead of having to swap between coding and designing. However, sometimes when little time is given, it gets very hard to avoid doing that. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because it will allow me to gain actual work experience and valuable insight on whichever company I'm with. After one graduates college, it is very hard to experience what many different companies are like and actually seeing which environment is best suited for you. What the Winternship program will allow me to do is not only gain more work experience coding (rather then class experience) but also allow me to add more to resume, so that future employers will be able to know that I'm serious about my work and that I have a lot of experience.",,"I would love to learn in this community/environment because it would be a place where so many different and unique individuals will be gathered. Where everyone has a different experience in perspective on a variety of topics. When you have a diverse environment, you not only learn a lot more but the product of your work turns out better because of that valuable insight from everyone and their different backgrounds.

This interest lead me to start designing web pages with HTML/CSS and Javascript to replicate the web pages I admired and also to create my own. With time, I branched to other programming languages and I found myself mesmerized that I could create an app or software from a few lines of code. As well, I found myself obsessed with debugging. Testing and finding bugs, mostly from logic errors, enable me to restrategize my original plan. Tech continuously challenges and excites me because I can create anything from the tips of my fingertips and my logic.","During my previous winternship at Bitly, it was a small team of 3. We were insecure and doubtful at first that three students, with minimal knowledge of CS, wouldn't be enough but our teamwork propelled us to achieve our goals and even go beyond them. Our goal was to complete the winternship project given to us and to network with the company. As we worked on the project, I found myself taking on the leadership role, such as organizing our thoughts, feedback, and directing how we should attack every obstacle we go through. Every morning we did a stand up meeting, wrote down our goals for the day, and our obstacles of that day. Next time, the one thing I would do differently is to believe in myself more. Whenever we hit an obstacle, we assumed it was our fault and our lack of knowledge. However, it was often the files we were given that had syntax errors in them. We assumed these bugs were from us and not from the open source github and often wasted time on these problems. In my next internship, I will believe in my skills and in myself and attack the errors confidently!","Participating in winternship programs allow women like me to propel ourselves to success. My previous winternship allowed me to gain real on the job knowledge. This not only helped me prepare my expectations for a job but also learn what it takes to be successful at certain roles. As well, it allowed me to learn the different roles in a tech company. With this winternship, I hope to further my experience in the work industry and gain more skills for my tool belt. Most importantly, I look forward to networking and gaining mentors to learn from. I, personally, find it difficult to network and hope this winternship may help me overcome this obstacle. ","At my previous winternship, I learned certain tools used by the company to work smoothly in a team such as stand up meetings, GitHub, Slack, Ticketing systems.

I grew more quiet in class and I focused on enhancing my skills.

I started my first year at Baruch College and began to question my major.  I abruptly felt anxious and unsure of my major.

","I worked well on a team when I was apart of a string quartet as a first violinist.  I was in a string quartet with a fellow violin player, viola player, and bass player.  Off the bat, a string bass in a string quartet is not typical and rarely seen. With the other violinist's help, we would compose music and try to find arrangements so that each one of us in the quartet had a noteworthy part.  That was a tedious task due to the fact we had a bass player and not a cello in our string quartet.  The goal of our string quartet was to play at small events that requested live music. All four of us then had to agree on occasions we could all attend and prepare our event's repertoire. We mostly focused on pop music or well-known music to go around the stereotype that string instruments can only play classical music.  I was in charge of setting up our meeting times and making sure we had a space to rehearse.  Thus, Category 4 (our string quartet) was born. When there were incidents that one player couldn't make an event, I was in charge of finding a replacement player. If I couldn't find another player, we would divide the part of the person who couldn't attend if it was necessary. It was challenging to find time to rehearse since we were all four completely different individuals with differing schedules. Overall, the string quartet required a lot of patience and hard work to make our performances possible.  Regardless of how tiresome the practicing and workload became, being apart of this team and outstanding string ensemble was life-changing.  It gave me a different perspective on music. We all played a crucial role, and although I enjoyed taking charge most of the time, my other fellow string players helped.  Next time, if I were to be apart of another musical group, I would try to find a stable rehearsal space. I would also have more rehearsals to be even more prepared for events.

You have a malware attack happening in your network? There is a cybersecurity team already on the case. Want to optimize your business and make better decisions? Reach out to a data analyst or scientist for a detailed look into what your company can do to improve services.  As a freshman, I considered the different majors I could pursue. In the beginning, I decided on finance. However, my heart was still driven towards technology. The main reason as to why I didn't seriously consider technology back then was because I felt I had no foundation and knowledge in the field. Also, I did not know of any resources that could tell me more about what it was like to pursue a career in tech. Just the mere fact of wanting to know more about this ""unknown"" made me begin researching and participating in tech activities. I began going to events and career workshops that taught more about the different opportunities in tech. From cybersecurity competitions, to hackathons and even data challenges, I began applying my newfound knowledge in a variety of different programs and becoming more experienced in the fields. Over these two years of breaking through in tech, I've sincerely enjoyed my time becoming more knowledgeable and communicating with others who are interested in the same things I am in. I can imagine myself doing this every day in my career ahead, while ACTUALLY enjoying what I do. As things grow and change over time, I am hopeful of what is to come and becoming more equipped to tackle projects in the future.","This past summer, I worked on a summer coding project through the CodeDay CodeLabs program. I was assigned to a group with 2 other girls alongside a mentor. The goal of our team was to create a fully functional website app by the end of a month's time, that addressed an issue currently occurring in the community. After consultation with our mentor, we began working on a COVID-19 Tracking app that provided real time statistics of COVID-19 related cases. Our goal was to complete the app and show the different ways in which the virus impacts the healthcare system in every state including daily increase hospitalizations, deaths, recovered, etc. Each of us looked at a different aspect of the cases and were responsible in creating a fully functioning frontend and backend operation. While I used Python to develop my part of the project, my fellow group members used Java. Although we worked on the project in our own respective languages, I slowly transitioned into holding more of a team leader position. Since I was the oldest of the group members, they looked towards me for direction and support during the project. I was actively communicating with them as well as our mentor. In addition, I was in charge of the entire coordination in preparing a demo and submission of the final product.  All 3 of us put in the same amount of work for creating the app. This helped us produce a product that displayed accurate information in a sleek format, making our work be further appreciated by program administrators. Although it was difficult at first getting everyone organized and keeping track of changes, we ended up producing a memorable application.  For next time, I’d definitely want to work in making our group members grow more comfortable with each other. I noticed that everyone, including our mentor, was shy and wouldn’t talk much. It took almost three virtual meetings for everyone to open up and discuss ideas they had for the project. I think that if we spent more time getting to meet each other earlier and collaborated in team building activities, we could’ve evolved the project. With everyone’s opinions on features to add to the web app, it could’ve looked much different than what It came out to be like. However, even with that, I think the entire experience was amazing and it opened my eyes up to what it is like working in a programming position. It was an experience unlike any other and definitely acted as a great challenge for me.","I would like to participate in this Winternship program because I have directly seen the impact this program has on helping people achieve their personal, academic, and professional goals. A few of my friends participated in what was previously WITNY, where they had the opportunity to intern at a company for some time in January. I could see the growth they underwent. They developed skills that they always wanted to focus on. They improved their communication skills and learned of how to further establish themselves as members of the tech industry. I had also applied last year but was unfortunately unable to secure a spot. However, since then I remained motivated to continue in my pursuit of joining programs that would help me improve upon my skills.  For this Winternship program specifically, I have several personal and professional goals. They include:  Personal: 1) Growing confidence in my programming skills: I have had experience programming before but still I get nervous going into a project. I’d like to tackle a real business project that requires the use of programming skills. 2) Make fear my friend- I sometimes get nervous walking into a new environment because of all the uncertainties that lie ahead. Instead of viewing it as a negative, I want to embrace the fear and use it to produce positive energy while doing any task.  3) Come out of the program making long term connections, whether it be with fellow interns or program heads. I want to walk out of the experience knowing that I built connections with people who have the similar passions as mine.   Professional: 1) Get experience working in the tech industry under professionals who can speak more about what it is like navigating early on in one’s career 2) Be able to apply knowledge through a project that solves a business problem- I’ve worked on projects before, but they never were in the context of solving a business problem from beginning to end, including the planning, implementation and presentation. I’d like to gain a deeper understanding of how one walks through the decision making and solving process in a company. 3) Understand how to navigate through work-life balance",,"In my own experience, I have noticed that individuals who come from underrepresented communities tend to be motivated to rise out of their current struggles to emerge as leaders and make a mark in the community. I, myself, am a first-generation female-identifying student who has had opportunities unlike those that my parents did. My parents’ struggle has motivated me to rise up from our current situation, establish myself and make them proud. Similarly, I know that in an environment such as this one, where there will be other individuals coming from underrepresented groups, there will be a greater sense of competitive energy that will drive the program. Every single person in the program has a reason to be there, whether it be personal, academic, professional, etc. They will also be there to raise the bar to the next level. They will ask questions, work on themselves, and learn things they haven’t known before. I want to be surrounded by such dedicated people as well because one’s environment helps shape the way they behave and respond to situations. Working alongside such people will help me in pushing myself towards producing results and improving upon my own skills.

It takes a lot of hardwork and dedication to own your craft and say you know what, these are the skills I have to offer you and you should appear the best to your ability to carry out those skills you do best. My family didn't have a lot of money growing up, and many of my friends from school went to respectable universities throughout the East coast. I would still want to say as long as you put in hard work and dedication into learning and working, no one can ever take that away. The reason why it is important to me is because I was a student growing up whom school officials claimed they had intellectual setbacks in meeting standardized scoring. In 9th grade of high school, I was able to get out of this program due to high marks and rigorous studying. Zoom past four years later, my high school nominated me for the Posse scholarship to Franklin and Marshall College. My family was very happy and excited for me as I was going to probably be the first in my family to go to a private college. I am happy they didn't accept me to that college because It has better shaped me who I am today and what I can do today has taught me many great lessons.

An IT career is an exciting option. The few reasons of career in tech are exciting:- job growth, job diversity, strong income, mobility, and grows critical thinking.   Since technology is developing and rising rapidly, so are many of the jobs. For instance, the development of automation permitted by technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence, causes the engagement of higher richness (economic growth), increased effectiveness, safety, and convenience. These boost the demand for labor in industries or jobs that arise or develop due to the productivity effect.  Nowadays, all industries need designers and developers to author custom hardware, software, multimedia, and business applications to benefit their workflow and produce alterations. For example, retails, banks, healthcare sectors, Etc. With these new operations, industries can manage and allow the inner workings of their tech systems and provided support. The tech industry's roles are very diversely demanding of scientific, social, and vocation abilities.   ","I was participating in New York Road Runner in summer 2018.

It helped me to boost my confidence, finished the race, and understand different cultures. I even learned count numbers in Spanish. My role was as a team to motivate and support other girls. They also gave me advices that helped me through the race. I would work as a team, make sure 'we' in the group, and learn different teammates' skills.

For as long as I can remember the only computer we had was a big, black, and clunky Dell desktop in the apartment. When I was a child, my parents warned me not to use it and every time I turned it on, the settings were in an alien and cryptic language … Mandarin. I was not exposed to Computer Science until I tested into a high school outside my neighborhood. All of the sudden, I was exposed to a field that excited me and at the same time was lucrative. 	 From a very young age, I saw firsthand how ugly the American Dream was, watching my parents work long hours as waitstaff in Chinese restaurants. Now during Covid, I have become the sole income earner in the household and incredibly grateful that software engineering is such a rewarding and comfortable career path. I am both incredibly excited about the technical aspect of technology yet grounded by the fact that technology could do a lot more for people like my parents. I believe that my experience working at mission driven companies reflect that. From Numina, an eight-person startup aimed at making our streetscapes in cities safer. To the New York Times, trying to seek the truth and help people understand the world.  Speaking from the perspective of a person born and raised in New York City, smart city and civic technology excites me the most. I am interested in how the benefits of technology can be more equitable. As the population grows and urbanization worsens, there are questions of declining quality of life in cities and who are the people most adversely affected. To be able to build systems that can impact the population at scale is both a technically and socially rewarding career.  ","In October of 2018, I attended my very first Hackathon at Cooper Union. What made this Hackathon so special was that it was my very first. Wide-eyed and excited, I had the opportunity to interact with hackers and mentors from various backgrounds.  This large pool of talent was also part of my fear of attending a Hackathon. I had never experienced working in a group of strangers and been expected to produce something in such a short amount of time.   After forming a team with 2 other strangers and given a time frame of 24 hours, we were excited to get started. However, the initial ideation process was what took us the most time. We were coming up with projects that were too technically complex, or uninspired. This sort of writer’s block plagued us for the majority of the hackathon. After a while of making very little progress, we decided to go around and enjoy the amenities and events that sponsors were holding.  That was when inspiration struck, we decided to make a VR application to help hackers at hackathons discover information about companies. By scanning a company-branded sticker our app would a useful summary of what the company is about.  Once we were excited about the project idea, we finally started working on it. However, none of us had worked with VR or Unity before and powered by caffeine and YouTube tutorials we finally ended up at the end of the 24 hours with a finished demonstration. It worked well and we placed 3rd.    Looking back, if I were to do it again, I believe the ideation process was our biggest pain point. We should have systematically targeted ideas that aligned with our skillsets instead of just freely brainstorming. I would have also taken a break much earlier instead of being blocked. In terms of development on the project, even though the result turned out well, we should have again divided or modularized the project so that it suited our skillsets. Because of the time pressure and unfamiliarity with the technology, instead of splitting up the work, the three of us were doing the same task the entire time.",I am looking for exposure to different technology companies and the type of work they are doing. I also seek mentorship through this Winternship. The technology space is so vast and there are several different career paths. I hope to gain some insight in that respect.,,"During the summer of 2019, I attended the AWS NYC conference was hosted at the Javits Center. As I walked past the restrooms, there was a long line of people that extended out of the men's room out into the hall. While the line for the women’s restroom was nonexistent. This simple disparity between the long stream of people waiting for the men’s room while no one seems to be using the women’s clearly illustrated in my mind the diversity issues in tech.   I wrote before that the most exciting part of technology for me is civic technology. Technology that is aimed towards helping people like my parents who faced harsh challenges migrating from a different country. But I believe the best way to foster this civic mindset is to first address the problems in the field. I am incredibly grateful for my upbringing and my parents’ changelogs have given me a unique perspective.

There I would be assigned to a team of other volunteers where we had to assist elderly patients with their daily activities such as: helping them eat, putting on their clothes and talking to them to keep them company while their loved ones were away. The activities would be split amongst me and my team members and it was up to us to decide who would do what, together we worked out a plan and decided that each member would exchange activities the following week. Our efforts combined and with the help of great communication we established a productive workflow and enjoyed the work that we did, there I made many friends while I was there. I was also engaged in a pre-health club at my college for 2 years, and became an active member of the pre-med community. I helped form various charity events for diseases like breast cancer and children’s cancer. At the club I learned how to work in a group and split tasks among my peers such as setting up different bake sales and inviting members of the health community to our school for seminars and talks. The skills and experiences I gained from those activities improved my ability to work with others and especially in groups as well as the ability to gain more knowledge about my field of interest.

Also, working alongside other peers will aid in enhancing my technical and application skills within a supervised setting. From such experiences, the program can ultimately improve my confidence in problem-solving, critical thinking. Validity of information sources, and collaboration in the social setting.

Technology is not only a limitation to a career in tech but it is an attribute to everything that we want to create. As our society advance's we are able to realize that a lot of problems arise within different demographics and creating a sense of organization or collecting that data and making an output that solves these problems go in a far extension. Something as simple, as doing the research behind an electric car opens up the possibility of understanding what kind of demographic will that car be for? Then that leads onto questions well how can we market that? How can we know to take what we marketed and know where people are buying the most of the car. Technology is essential to navigate the world and create changes to a consumer, and interactions. It is what notices the problem and makes something out of it, in steps that are organized and consistently build and it is never stagnant. ","A time when I worked well on a team, was during my last Winternship. In my last internship at IBM, we have presented two tasks, to split amongst the group. As a group, we all realized that one task grabbed our attention more than the other but that would not be challenging us as individuals, and we needed a strong set of both programmers, marketers, and engineers to think on one team, as all companies don't exist with one narrow mind. The goal of our team was to accomplish a Bootcamp schedule for students that allowed them to be exposed to problems in Comcast and contribute the partners to both IBM and P-Tech. Our other task was to come up with a list of media and entertainment companies for the IBM Cloud Paka that can adhere. I was able to contribute a background from a computer scientist and come up with an algorithm that made the Cloud Paka finding partner's process easier. I noticed that we worked backwards majority of the time by finding the key- terms that aligned with media and entertainment using these keywords I came up with an algorithm that can be used. My role in the team helped simplify our time and actually get the assignment done earlier than expected as my team was able to realize what kind of companies we were looking for. For, the next time I would have built more on the algorithm to automatically create a ""green light' for the companies that we felt tailored IBM's purpose. ","I want to participate in the Winternship program because last winter was my first time that I participated in and I still reference this internship in every interview and it helped me understand where I fit in my role in tech. As anyone in technology would agree, your network and peers are the most important people within your journey. Since my internship at IBM, I've been able to get certifications during quarantine that opened in their company and kept in contact with their company. I think it is important to understand what kind of companies are there and what roles are prevelant very young . ","I have been able to apply my skills and experiences from my previous Winternship to speak amongst my own interviews, and also know what to expect from other internships. Partaking in a company's environment and project I was able to carry on the examples of organizing, researching, conducting, and testing within an internship. At IBM, I had a lot of creative freedom and understanding that other people are willing to hear your contribution just as much as you believe in it. I've applied these skills to set up meetings, ask questions more vividly, and seek a new idea for tutorials. ","I want to learn in this environment and community because they are honest. The Break Through Tech New York Program has been very assistive towards my tech journey, making me realize I'm my biggest marketer at all times.

Our team consisted of three people working on pixel art, one on music and two programmers but often many of our jobs were intertwined as we gave constructive criticism on each others works. My role in the team was to work together with our other programmer to create the game itself and to utilize the work by our other members to create a coherent and enjoyable experience. One aspect of my role on the team that I would do differently is to better communicate the specifications of different things that I am looking for as often the artists would have different scales for their art as I never clearly told them what to use. Additionally, I feel that I should ask others for their input more often as occasionally I would finish a certain aspect of the game and then ask how it is instead of inquiring early about it, saving crucial time. ","Like many others, my initial purpose to wanting to participate in the Winternship program was to gain experience in the field that would help greatly aid in the search for additional internships as well as jobs in the future. However, an internship is more than an entry in a resume and the actual experience working on a project will greatly improve one's skills as well expand their knowledge on different technologies that companies use. Aside from programming, the internship will also allow me to foster other skills that are required to work in the field such as those that will help in landing a job like writing a better resume as well as networking and building connections with others. One additional reason that I would like to participate in the Winternship program is that it allows me to work on a project that may have specifications laid out as I have difficulty coming up with a project by myself that will be sufficient to prove my capabilities.

The last team I was associated with, was during the start of the pandemic. Although each family was trying to deal with this circumstantial issue of staying home and juggling their kids as well as keeping up with their demanding jobs, we were able to accomplish our tasks on time.  I at times had to delegate between taking the leadership role, and relinquishing the power to my teammates. We all contributed to the project, though at times, I followed up with my members to not only check on them and their mental health, but to also verify if they are progressing with the project. I also offered assistance if they were to require it.  If there was one thing I would handle differently, it would be, better manage my time. Although, all tasks and assignments were handed in on time, there were times where assignments were incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances, as well as lack of communication."," According to the description, this program is a career development workshop that will immerse me into a career in technology. I am looking to expand my career. I would eventually like to work in cybersecurity, or at least enter the field of data analysis. I believe this workshop will start me off in that direction.

When I was younger, at the time I Was still residing in the West Indies, my uncle had brought home a computer that had to use dial-up to access the internet. I never understood the purpose of it, but somehow I was infatuated with it, and how it worked. It wasn't until later on that my infatuation grew along with the evolution of technology. I always managed to tinker away, even though I was not allowed to touch or change any of the features on the computer. As I got older, I realized that there wasn't that many that looked like me in the field or any who was interested in figuring out why these things seemed to operate the way that they do. Eventually I started to think the logic behind these things were hard and confusing, and that women held no place in these fields. So I eventually went for my Bachelors in Business, but somehow in taking a CIS requirement course, my curiosity got the better of me, and eventually inspired me to attend a trade school that was offering CompTIA A+ certification. Unfortunately, after a couple failed attempts and a brief hiatus, I've returned, this time to acquire a full degree in CIS. I believe had I had  the opportunity to network with women within the technical field, I probably would have gotten a little further than where I'm currently at.

","A time when I worked well on a team was in high school when I was tasked to build a robot that would take pictures with three other group members. The goal for us was to have it work by the deadline which would take a good amount of time and effort.

It is amazing to see how far we have advanced in such a short amount of time. I am intrigued by the idea of having a career in tech. I consider myself a creative person, and a tech career is appealing in the fact that creativity is rewarded. Another attribute of a tech career is the impact it can have on others. For example, software engineers can create apps that make other peoples' lives easier. I think it would be an amazing feeling to know that you have been able to make an impact on someone's life without even having to meet them. ","Two summers ago, I was hired at a newly opened restaurant in Manhattan. I was hired under the position of a team member, in which I was expected to merely be on the cash register. However, it was a very small and tight knit team of five people. Our goal was for the restaurant to flourish. We became close and soon I was not only a cashier, but a fundamental part of the restaurant team. I was assisting with multiple tasks: helping with the decoration and interior design, designing the menu using Photoshop, taste testing items to help tweak the recipe, being in charge of the social networking pages, spreading awareness through handing out flyers, and even helping with the hiring process. It was incredibly rewarding to have a voice and see changes occur based on my recommendations and opinions. And even more rewarding was to see our business improve from our hard work and dedication. However, it was quite stressful handling all the workload, and I experience some burnout. If I were to do it over again, I would probably ask others for help more often.","As a newly declared computer science major, the Winternship program would be an amazing opportunity for me. It would expose me to the tech industry and allow me to explore what interests me. I would love to make new connections and meet other fellow aspiring computer science majors. Furthermore, most of the companies that are participating in the Winternship are familiar to me, and to be able to intern under them would be an unbelievable opportunity.

I have always had an interest in computer science, and in my junior year of high school, I took a computer technology class in which I was the only female in a class of thirty students. It was very uncomfortable for me, as my teacher would constantly make sexist jokes and address the class as ""gentlemen... and lady."" I attempted to swap the class by going to the programming office at my high school, where the computer science department head laughed at my request, and said I should feel lucky to have all the attention to myself. At that point, I gave up and would dread going to class everyday. This experience gave me a bad impression of the tech field overall. It took a lot of courage for me to change my major in my college career to computer science, as coding was something that always intrigued me, but I was too intimidated to pursue.

I think that technology is vital to my role, and would love to learn more about the skills needed for programming. Moreover, I feel that in tech there is more creativity when it comes to solving problems as well as creating solutions. With these characteristics, I want to find a career to merges the ideals of an accountant with the careers in tech - fintech particularly. Some of the roles that interest me include IT Audit, Marketing Analytics, Tech Consulting, and others.

Lastly, another thing that interests me about a career in tech is the ""newness"" of it. There is so much more to be developed, learned, and created. I would love to be part of an industry that does that. ","During the summer I participated in a case study competition at KPMG where our goal was to sell a pitch of a made up product in 60 seconds. Our product was focused on telemarketing and creating a hotline for employees at KPMG. If employees had questions regarding anything related to the coronavirus pandemic, then they could dial our hotline, and every number would represent something. For example, 1 would be the nearest hospital, 2 would be how the stock market is during the pandemic, and much more. We were given 10 minutes to create this presentation, therefore the group members and I decided to split up teams. I would be the one creating the actual presenation and speaking on the product itself. The goal of the team was to present efficiently and effectively, and we did this by splitting up the roles as well as communicating to one another about what our duties were. My contributions focused on the visuals as well as speaking.   During the presentation, one of our group members forgot his lines, so there was a moment of awkward silence. However, instead of letting the silence continue, I decided to pick up his lines so all of the questions were answered. After the presentation, I realized that there were some things I would do differently. Although we did amazing, I feel that next time I would definitely make sure everyone knows there lines by setting aside half of the time allotted to running through with the presentation.

I would love to divulge more into programming and data analytics. Also my school does offer programming courses, which I plan on taking as well as getting an MIS, but I would love to be part of a program outside of school just to learn more and gain insight. Some of my more personal goals includes building close knit friendships with people in this program. Because it is only three weeks, I still feel that you can grow connections and build a community within this amount of time. Most of my friends are in accounting majors, which is great, but I would love to understand more about the tech community and make friends!

I was assigned to a group in which some of the group members did not have as much excitement as I did for the final project.

After assigning roles and tasks that each of our group members had to focus on, I started seeing a lack of motivation. It was going and worse every day, from not completing the tasks, to actually giving up as people kept questioning whether it was worth doing it. The progress between members differed very much, and I understood that people who weren't doing what they were assigned to, either would not complete them or finish them at the last moment, leaving us with an incomplete and unrevised section of the website. Usually, I would go with the flow of the group and agree to what most people said, but this time I wanted to make it work and try to win this competition. This led me to constantly checking up on team members and making sure that the progress was happening. There were moments when I worked with people on their section and some could not finish their section so I had to take over it.

The direction you can apply your technical skills to is broad enough to be tailored to other specific interests, such as design or to some financial discipline. With this in mind, the opportunities present for me are genuinely vast for someone who fancies having options. Another significant interest in pursuing a career in tech is the intimidation factor that it generates within me. With less than 1% of women graduating with tech-related degrees, men have notoriously dominated the tech industry for the longest time. While Break Through Tech is actively working towards dismantling those barriers, the intimidating atmosphere of being surrounded by mainly male counterparts, even in the classroom, absolutely terrifies me. However, I choose to use that fear as a fueling motivator rather than a deterrent. It challenges me to prove that I am capable of working alongside like-minded individuals, even as a minority. With this in mind, I strive to achieve and produce the best possible results so that I can close the gender gap within the field. There is nothing more exciting than being able to develop something better for future generations while satisfying my desire to learn and grow as a professional and personal level continually. ","My most prominent group project was during my last internship. It was my first time working on a larger team in the office environment rather than in the classroom setting. The team objective was creating a very open-ended product, entirely responsible for all the schematics that lay behind developing a product. We spearheaded the conceptualization of an idea and progressed into its developmental stages to produce a final deliverable. Undoubtedly, minor tensions did arise as a result of all the different personalities part of the group. As someone who views effective collaboration as an essential component to a successful group, my self-appointed role was to ensure that my group remains as harmonious as possible. While it would have been impossible to satisfy everyone's desires, it was vital that everyone felt included and comfortable as could be. I wanted to achieve an impressive final deliverable and maintain and form amicable relationships with my team members. My team contribution is my hard technical skills and a vast, well-developed array of interpersonal skills that years in a client-facing role have taught me. The skills I have learned as a cashier has enabled me to know how to minimize tensions while creating an overall enjoyable environment for maximized productivity. Since there is always room for improvement, I would want to find a better balance in displaying my technical side in future team-based projects. My focus on upkeeping pleasant collaboration withheld me from pursuing my inclinations. While I contributed to the overall project, I would have liked to partake more in terms of the technical portion to display, practice, and strengthen my abilities. ","Participating in the winternship program is pivotal in aiding my career ambitions. Candidly, the industry heavily relies on personal connections to improve the chances of acquiring a company position. Participating in this program allows me to grow my network in a professional setting for future opportunities. However, the program goes beyond aiding the idealistic desire to land a job straight out of college. The program is significant in allowing me to acquire industry experience. After participating in the last Winternship program, I learned a multitude of new information, insight from professionals, ways of maneuvering a professional setting; but it gave me an exposure to the knowledge I lack. Being in the physical work environment showed me everything that I have yet to learn. I believe it is more important to be aware of my shortcomings so that I may strengthen those weak points. As I near the end of my academic career, I have begun applying for other internships. However, I still lack confidence primarily, alongside the essential technical knowledge that I am just beginning to learn this semester. This lack of confidence from feeling unprepared often leads me to opt-out of interviews before even commencing them. The program can help prepare me for these situations through the gained knowledge and valuable experiences that provide substance to discuss in interviews. Before the last Winternship, I wasn't exposed to much teamwork(an essential aspect of the industry). Therefore, I couldn't adequately respond to the commonly recurring question of how I work in teams or what prior team-based projects I have been apart of. Through the Winternship program, I was able to gain that vital experience for future reference. I am extremely eager to delve into the workforce of a career that I am passionate about. I believe my participation in this program can help accelerate and aid this goal through the invaluable experience and relationships formed as a result alongside a supportive, empowering community. ","Given the unforeseen abrupt circumstances of a global pandemic, my exploration of more CS-related activities and experiences minimized. My current occupation of a supermarket worker during this circumstance lead to an unwanted increase in my shift hours. I went from working part-time to forcibly working 40 or more hours. Between working and managing my online classes, this reduced the amount of leisure time I had available. I initially wanted to attempt working on an independant project, similar to what we had done during the internship but lacked the free time. On the contrary, the pandemic has been beneficial to a certain extent in providing resources that were not previously available. One of the technologies that I learned about when working with my previous Winternship company was mySQL and Databases. The minimal exposure to SQL language left me curious to know more. My college doesn't formally teach these concepts until a later time. Given the pandemic, Harvard University began offering free online courses through edX, one relating to introductory SQL and Databases. Since I had a lingering curiosity to SQL from my previous internship, I voluntarily enrolled in the academic opportunity provided by Harvard and have been progressing through the course during my own time. Moreover, the teamwork experiences I learned in my previous participation have been applied towards more career opportunities by providing me with a talking point for other internship applications. I formally wasn't fond of or comfortable talking/writing about myself when filling out applications which reflected onto my success rate in hearing back from the companies. Now I have been learning how to refine and discuss my contributions and attributes on applications with more ease, allowing me to receive more considerations into companies' interview process than before. ","Coming from an underrepresented group myself, the reason I appreciate being apart of this community is because it provides a sense of belonging. As I previously mentioned, the tech field breeds this intimidating atmosphere that is anxiety inducing. Belonging to this community allows me to feel a part of a more grand-scale schema rather than a minuscule individual. The community not only empowers me through being surrounded by equally driven peers, but it gives me a platform to help empower and motivate other females who feel the similar emotions I do. With an ever changing social environment, the importance of being able to understand the perspective of dissimilar backgrounds is imperative to creating a change that can accommodate more than just one group representation. Coming from an underrepresented group doesn't mean that I understand the struggles of all other underrepresented groups. Hence, this environment educates  me on the diverse backgrounds apart from my own so that I may learn to understand the experiences of others through a different lens. This environment helps me to continually grow, formulate well-rounded decisions, and provide and receive support on an emotional and professional basis.

I am satisfied with everything that I said, but if there is one thing I would like to add is how absolutely and genuinely meaningful the entirety of Break Through Tech has been to me. I truly believe that my participation with these programs has enabled me to continue pursuing this career through the combination of my own zealous nature to succeed and the support enabling me to help dismantle barriers together, as a community of ambitious women.

I chose computer science because it seemed like a safe choice as there are many opportunities and many different varieties of jobs in technology. After experiencing my first real coding class in college, I realized that coding is not easy at all. Coding is challenging for me, and it gives me a sense of satisfaction when I finally figure out a concept. This is the main reason why I am interested in a career in technology. I like that computer science challenges me. Plus, I always thought that computers were cool. I have always been amazed at how powerful technology can be. How amazing it is that my whole life can revolve around a piece of technology and how amazing it is that the world of technology continues to evolve and improve lives every day.","In one of my Spring 2020 courses, I had to work with a group of classmates to create a solution to a problem that we had on campus. The problem that we had was campus security. We came up with a solution to implement turnstiles in the main building of our college campus. The goal of my team was to put together a presentation and pitch our idea to our audience. Our group had seven members, including me. For the project, I had to work closely with two other members to create the proposed tasks of our solution, which are the tasks that we would follow to integrate the turnstiles on campus. The role I had on the team was the leader, and my main task was to make sure my classmates were on schedule with their research and assignments. I also had to communicate with each member and plan a good time for meetings. The most challenging thing was communication because this project was completed over quarantine. The only way of communicating was through our phones or zoom, and some members would not reply to messages. The only thing I would do differently next time is to encourage members to communicate more often in the group chat to ask questions and give updates on the changes made. This will keep everyone in the loop and will make things less confusing.","There are many reasons as to why I want to participate in the Winternship program. The main reason is to gain real-world experience. Learning how to code is something that I am doing in college. However, applying that knowledge is entirely different and way more challenging to do on my own.

It usually consisted of four members, with people coming and going over time.

My goal was to create a website for the team, participate in customer discover, do research on our indirect and direct competitors, and attend networking events as a representative of the group.  I also drafted and formatted our business plan, created documents for our interviews and soap trials, and talked to well regarded investors with the founder.

","During my other Winternship, I took it upon myself to interact with people at Dow Jones and learn what it means to be with women of different personalities.

The possibilities are quite literally endless when it comes to a career in tech. For instance, I can choose to work in the medical field or a startup company since both include various tech jobs related to its specific task. Personally, I love trying new things and so having a career in tech does by no means restrict me in any way; I would be free to work towards multiple goals. For example, with a career in tech, I could have the option of helping my community locally or go bigger and help others on a global scale through an economic standpoint or social standpoint. Additionally, there are numerous roles within tech that are specific to hard technical skills and soft skills. There are roles available for everyone’s preference, and I find that very interesting as not every role is the same. I look forward to the unlimited opportunities that come with such a dynamic field. I would be constantly learning with a career in tech as technology is ever evolving.  ","A time when I worked well on a team was during my internship at Aetna with four other girls. The goal of my team was to develop a prototype to implement interoperability between healthcare constituents using FHIR API’s and HL7 standards. I contributed much of the organization of the team and project. Each of us took turns playing the role of scrum master which meant ensuring the team follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to using. In our case, we each ensured our daily tasks were met, however, many of my team members were initially confused as to how to appropriately carry out the role of scrum master. I took the initiative to ask for further guidance from our mentors and took on the role first so that my team members could hopefully follow suit. I continued with this role more often than my team members as I organized our tasks at hand and ensured everyone had their specific task completed each day so that we could progress. Additionally, this role meant ensuring a good relationship between the team and others outside the team. Our team had to coordinate with another team to create one coherent product, and I facilitated the communication between each team. My other role was to also help research background information needed to understand our project in the first place. What I would do differently next time is take the time to appreciate and employ my team member’s strengths from the start. I think because we were mostly consumed with completing the project in a short 3-week time period, we could not hone our individual skills and strengths. If we took the time to identify each of our strengths and appreciate them, each of us would have been more confident in our abilities to successfully complete the project as a group. While our mentors were extremely helpful in guiding us, I think identifying our individual strengths from the start would have helped us come together more as a team.  ","My personal goal for participating in the Winternship Program is to be a part of something bigger than myself, which is to bridge the gender gap that exists in the field of tech. Although I am only one person, I hope to potentially help get one step closer to closing this gender gap. I would love to earn the satisfaction that I was a part of achieving a greater mission in mind.   My academic goal for the Winternship Program is to further my knowledge of coding languages and learn how coding can be applied in the real world at successful companies. The projects done while learning computer science in the classroom may not directly link with the projects done in a workplace, and so I hope to learn the specifics of a company’s use of coding. I want to hone my technical skills from the classroom and be able to apply it in practice.  Professionally, I am looking to expand my network of connections related to the role of product manager within various industries. I would love to learn more about the responsibilities and skills needed to become a product manager as I am interested in this specific role in tech. ","	I have been able to apply a technical skill from my previous Winternship to my academic career. Specifically, I wrote some code in Java in my last Winternship, which is a language I had not previously learned. This helped me with my software design class in the spring semester that required writing code in Java. I have not been able to apply any other skills as I have not yet been involved in any further career opportunities in tech. ","	I want to learn in this environment and community because it provides a safe space for me to unapologetically make mistakes and grow from them without having the pressure of male peers. It’s no secret that males overwhelmingly dominate the tech industry, but this space allows me to fully participate and speak up because I have the support of other women and only women. I shy away a lot less in this environment because I am much more comfortable with a group that shares the same struggles as I do. We are allowed to use that commonality to our advantage and create something positive out of it where we grow together.  ",Yes,Bronx,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"	Although I am a junior in a computer science program, I still feel as if my technical skills are weaker than my male counterpart. I think it may stem from feeling discouraged from participating in a predominantly male class, or seeking help from my male professors. I felt a massive difference when I had a female professor for one of my most important computer science classes as I actively went to ask for help and felt more comfortable within that learning space. Regardless, I honed more of my soft skills through my experiences such as collaborating in teams using agile methodologies and communicating with my advisors and mentors when I need help.

However my most effective team was at a children’s summer school program. Our goal as a team was to be effective teachers for the students. The different people on our team were able to organize, prioritize, and ensure focus of the students. I was able to personally mentor and educate children in fun and creative ways. This meant using ways of incorporating my interest and knowledge of technology into educational ways that encouraged their imagination. If I had to do something different and if I had the resources, I would have been more hands on and allowed the students to create something to show them the different possibilities of technology within some simple skills.","By participating in the wintership program, it would allow me to apply my academic and personal knowledge into a professional setting.

Tech is an ever-growing field of study that has enabled plenty of advancements to man-kind. It has created so many opportunities to improve our liveliness, all the way from inventions such as gaming consoles that provide family entertainment and excitement to devices like the apple watch that monitor your health. The tech field ensured entrainment, simplicity, awareness, and safety to society and has given me an opportunity to help serve my community. ","A great example of a time where I worked well in a team would be during the final week of the full-stack javascript Bootcamp that I participated in during the summer of 2020. It was week four, the final week for the boot camp and our final assignment would be a capstone project utilizing all the knowledge we gained during our four weeks in the boot camp. Students would be assigned to groups of four with at least one student who knew CSS. In addition, each group would be assigned a tech assistant (TA). Each group would be given the liberty to create a project of their own. Unlike some other groups, my team was placed on a bit more of a strict timeline. The day we were assigned to our groups we all came to greet each other and get an understanding of how our schedules communed. Unfortunately, it seemed that everyone in the group would be either unavailable to meet or would have limited time to work on the weekend due to work or traveling out of state. So instead of having a full week to complete the project, we had 4-5 days. This had a strong impact on the choice of our project. We all had amazing ideas that we felt would be fun to create but we had to base our choice out which project would have an MVP that we could push out quickly, efficiently, and still enjoy. At last, we decided to create a dashboard that would enable a user to login in, create work out routine, save it to a specific day, edit or delete the workout, keep track of how many rep and sets were completed, search for video tutorials on how to perform an exercise if needed, and display it all in a calendar. Once we figured out our plan we discussed roles. I mentioned the fact we were not experts so we should work on our strengths and weakness during this project. I was placed in charge of setting up a schema for our project as well as researching how we would incorporate the youtube API into our program. Creating a schema was something I was familiar with because of my experience with a database course I took previously, but my skills with API was a bit shaky. To begin working on these strengths and weakness we decided that instead of coding independently we pair program through zoom. Finally, my team managed to complete our application and we received great remarks for it. I loved the project but to be frank, If I was to change anything about our project I would incorporate relational database instead of a non-relational database. My team voted that we should use firebase over MySQL because it was faster to put together and easier to learn which is true but when in the case that we were to continue to upgrade this project with more features in the future would prove difficult.","My reason for wanting to participate in the Winternship is to strengthen my team leading skills.

For a long time, I believed I am not artistic or decorative in any sense because I cannot draw or sketch. However, I enjoy designing in tech, such as web design, creating flyers, videos, and social media posts. I am very creative, and I love to create. Apps such as Adobe Design or Canva give me a space to play around with shapes, colors, sparkles, and stickers to make appealing posters. In web design, when creating a clean and color-coordinated user interface, I feel satisfied. As with Canva, I like to explore and choose different options for menu bars, icons, and wallpapers. My fascination with data is recent, and it came from seeing organized data on Google Forms. Through simple questions, such as what team you choose or what is your gender, the Google software organized user responses into pie charts, scatter plots, or bar graphs. It was intriguing to see the pie charts and graphs with their colors. I think I liked observing the scale or scope of responses, such as the different sections on a pie chart. Because of such interests, I believe a career in design or data management is worth exploring for me.","During my group interview for a position at CUNY Census Corps, my interviewer split us into different teams. He assigned each team an individual community and handed us a document containing information regarding it. The objective was for each team to use their given resources and best advertise the census to their assigned community. While a team presented their case, the rest of the group pretended to be community members. For my team, we first brainstormed by looking at the data. I noticed that there are top three common languages spoken in our area, so I brought up the idea of advertising in different languages. My team members found other strong points to advertise the census, such as MTA and public housing. Since we were taking too much time, I recall telling my team that we have enough good ideas and our time runs short, so we need to start designing. While my members who were decent with art worked on posters, I conversed with other members about who should speak first and what each member should share. I brought some index cards to assign talking points to everyone. I wanted to provide all my teammates a chance to share and show off their skills. In the end, I believe our presentation was decent. If we had more time, we could have done better. For instance, we did not have time to do posters in different languages. With more time, we could also discuss the order about who speaks what and when from beginning to end. Some people said a little too much, taking away points from other members. Nevertheless, I think my team did well, and I am happy with what we accomplished in such little time.

From high school up until now, I have had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of computer science from cybersecurity to app development, and I just recently worked with augmented/virtual reality. Every one of these experiences took what I learned in the classroom to the next level by reinforcing them in unique and useful ways. For instance, this past year, all of my computer science classes have been geared towards programming in C++ and learning to use Git and GitHub to submit assignments. I was able to take my C++ programming skills and experience with GitHub and apply them to my past internships. For instance, during my spring internship, though I had never worked with Unity or C# before, my experience with C++ allowed me to quickly learn the syntax of C#, which made understanding and using Unity much easier. Ultimately, I was able to use my programming skills to add key features to an Augmented Reality Construction application. Furthermore, during my previous Winternship, since I was working with three other colleagues on an application, I was expected to use Git and GitHub for version control and code merging. In classes, I had only learned the basics of using GitHub and had very little experience with using it for code reviews and version control. However, I was able to use my foundational knowledge of GitHub and truly understand how essential and powerful this tool is when you are collaborating with others on the same project or even when you’re working alone. As with my experience with C# and GitHub, there have been many instances where languages and concepts I’ve learned in class reappeared, allowing me to apply them to real-world problems. ","Through my Winternship last January, I had the opportunity to work at Cognizant Softvision with three other female colleagues who are also pursuing tech-related majors. The internship's goal was to create an IOS/Android application that would help Cognizant Softvision effectively manage their events. Initially, I chose to stay within my comfort zone and use my prior experience with app development to work on our application's front-end. However, after completing my first task, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and switch over to working with the application's back-end. As much as I loved working on the front-end and although I learned many new things about React Native, I knew switching to the back-end would give me exposure to an aspect of app development I had never explored. Furthermore, since this was a team effort, I was still able to contribute to the front-end whenever my team members were brainstorming ideas or were debugging code for the front-end of the application. Even though learning to work with the back-end was difficult, with a lot of support and encouragement from my fantastic team members, I was able to finish all of my tasks and help them finish theirs.   ","Whether through courses or internships, I have been privileged enough to explore various aspects of computer science. These experiences have increased my passion and appreciation for this field. Through this Winternship, I want to apply all of the skills I have acquired while also learning about an aspect of computer science I have yet to explore. Furthermore, through this Winternship, I hope to make more meaningful connections with other girls in the STEM field. During my last Winternship, I had a wonderful time working with my amazing colleagues. As I was the only freshman in the group, they gave me a lot of useful advice about navigating through college and shared many computer science-related opportunities with me. As a team, we worked wonderfully and always supported and encouraged each other. Though we only worked together for a month, we became close by the end, and we are still in touch today. ","There are many things I took from my previous Winternship and applied to my AR/VR internship, which took place last spring. While working at Cognizant Softvision, I participated in many Agile and Scrum related workshops, which taught me about project management and using Kanban boards, which break larger tasks down into smaller user stories. As the sprint progresses, these user stories are moved to different categories, such as “in-progress,” “blocked,” or “completed.” These workshops taught me a lot about the importance of staying organized and planning ahead. When I began my spring internship at SHoP Architect, their approach to working on projects was more laid back and spontaneous. As a result, I sometimes lost focus of what the end result of my task was supposed to be. I decided to bring over what I had learned about project management from my Winternship and suggested that we create a Kanban board. This allowed me to visualize the internship's end goals and break the goals down into smaller tasks. In addition, another skill I took away from my previous Winternship was my experience with GitHub. During the Winternship, I collaborated with my colleagues to create an application, which involved working in branches, performing code review, and resolving code conflicts. Initially, I was nervous about working with GitHub, but all of the terminal commands were ingrained in my memory by the end of the Winternship. During my spring internship, the coding practices were not as strict, and version control was not an issue because the team was very small. However, because I had minimal Unity experience, I did not want to risk messing up the master code and decided to work in branches before merging my code with the master. This was very helpful because even when my program did not work, the master copy of the app was safe from any potential mistake. ","I want to learn in this environment and community because I want to continue to grow both as a computer science student and as a woman in the STEM field. Sitting through computer science classes where a majority of my classmates are males is often frustrating and lonely. There are times when I question whether computer science is my true calling. However, it is the inclusive environment that Winternships foster that reaffirms that I do belong. My last Winternship was incredibly inspiring because not only did I gain a lot of knowledge and experience regarding software engineering, I also left with a lot of excellent advice and encouragement. Coming into the Winternship program, I initially struggled with imposter-syndrome because I was afraid I wasn’t qualified for my position. Fortunately, my teammates and I worked with many inspirational mentors throughout the internship who taught us not to be scared to ask questions and to always speak with confidence. I learned that it is okay to walk into a project without knowing everything as long as you have a strong desire to learn and grow. This is one piece of advice I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

I was really excited to learn how to use a graphing calculator for the first time. I was amazed by the fact that the small device was able to do various complex math problems in a matter of seconds. As soon as I got my hands on it, I found myself wondering about how it was made, how the input numbers are taken in by the calculator to produce outputs, and who initially discovered it. I wanted to take a trip inside the calculator and see how all the parts cooperate with each other to fulfill its occupation.      My interest in the technology field grew once I entered high school. During my freshman year, I took Drafting and Designs for Production (DDP) where everyone was taught to take an idea through the design process that will eventually be manufactured or produced. I learned various levels of engineering and engineering design by designing and building visually (using AutoCAD) and manually. Since then, I found it fascinating how we, humans, build complex machinery using basic items to make our lives easier and I want to contribute to the process of creating new things. "," I was a part of my high school’s Treble Choir. I genuinely loved being there because there is no feeling in comparison to the feeling of performing in front of an audience. It is the feeling of happiness, optimism, confidence, and the realization that anything is possible.    Our choir was split into four sections: Soprano 1, Soprano 2, Alto 1, and Alto 2. I was a Soprano 1 and we usually got the main melodies. At first, I got carried away with thinking that my voice part was the most important because I had the main melody but I was quick to correct my thinking. I realized that a song does not just shine with the main melody. It has various other components to it that makes a song mellifluous. The main objective of being in the choir was to give the audience a great show. The only way we were able to achieve it was when the sections worked together and sang their respective voice parts as required. If every individual tried to outshine the remaining members of the group by singing the main melody, then we will not be able to reach the final product to please the spectators. Together, we deliver a complex yet beautiful performance which will not be possible without the harmonies, background vocals, and instruments supporting the main melody.  I learned the true meaning of team work by being a part of this choir. It is about delivering the project as a group rather than it is about me as an individual. Moreover, one of the great things about being a part of the choir is growing together as a family with the people there. We were very supportive of one another and there was no room for any jealousy or any kind of negativity. Overall, I gained musical experience and came out as a better person by being a part of the choir.  ","     I have taken part in a few Tech related extracurricular events in high school. While I am grateful for those opportunities, they all leaned towards classroom situations.  I am really looking forward to being a part of the Winternship program because it will give me an insight into an actual workplace. I will be able to administer the knowledge I have learned from my collegiate classes into a practical manner. I will acquire many valuable skills such as workplace etiquette, business procedures, and presentation expertise that I can put into practice in my future career.       Additionally, the Winternship program fosters teamwork and I deeply recognize the importance of teams in a work environment. I work well with others because I am able to compromise and put different ideas together to see the bigger picture. I hope to learn important life lessons from my acquaintances that will help me be successful. I also believe that I have just as much potential to offer to the group.      This program will open many doors for me. I will be exposed to different work scenarios which will help me realize the type of work I want to do in this field. I will possibly be able to obtain connections for a future internship at the same firm. In general, I will gain precious experience that will be useful for me throughout my life.

Once a month, I invited a woman speaker who is in an established position in a STEM line of work to talk about their experiences and achievements in their work place.       As a woman of color, I am excited to be in a similar environment that promotes solidarity within underrepresented women in the tech field. I will be able to learn better because I will be exposed to a supportive environment where everyone will be welcomed regardless of their beliefs and identities. Being a part of this program will not only help me gain career skills but also will teach me valuable life lessons.      Moreover, I aim to use the knowledge and resources that I will have gained at the Winternship to create an impact in the lives of young girls who want to pursue a career in technology. My main priority will be to close the gender disparity on a global scale. I plan to offer more educational opportunities to women across the world to help them be a part of the STEM field.

Currently, my friends and I have started our start up app called ParkBreezy (for both android and iOS) where I am working as a front-end developer. This app will allow users in NYC to find parking and allow drivers who are not fluent in English to understand parking regulations through our built-in translations, which in the long run can help them avoid getting tickets/fines. The fact that I get to develop more of my tech skills and potentially make people’s life a lot easier when it comes to finding parking in NYC is what motivates me and excites me to continue developing this app.  Furthermore, my role as a front-end developer for ParkBreezy taught me many things. This includes how to program the numerous app screens (home screen, main screen, profile screen, etc.) and get functions on the screen to work by utilizing JavaScript and React Native. Moving forward, I can't wait to learn more languages and use new web frameworks to further my developing skills and build platforms that will be helpful to people. ","This summer I was given the opportunity to be a front-end developer intern for CodeDay Labs, where I got the chance to work with a Microsoft mentor along with two other college students. Our project was to create a website that will allow users to send messages/files with an option of setting a password and an expiration date. One of my fellow team members and I were both in charge of all the front-end components our website needed, however none of us had any experience in TypeScript and in React, so this project was an interesting challenge.   However, we both agreed to split the work in areas we felt confident in and help each other in areas we were weak in. Also, whenever my team member was stuck on her code, we would jump on a zoom call and try to figure it out together. With this dynamic we both were able to learn from each other and be successful in completing our project.  ","The best way to learn is through experience, especially in the tech field. Through this Winternship, my professional goal is to learn any new technical skills, whether that's a new programming language or working in a new technical environment, and most importantly I want to learn about a new industry and/or new technical roles that I have not had exposure to. For instance, I am really interested in the Fintech industry and would love to gain skills and explore possible tech roles in this industry. ","Since my previous Winternship, I have had a summer (2020) internship with CodeDay labs and started/and I am continuing to participate in startup competitions with my team’s app called ParkBreezy, which my friends and I have been developing. In both these activities my role has been a front-end developer, which I talked more about in the previous questions. But, the most memorable experience I had where I got to apply the skills I learned from my previous Winternship has been when I got to utilize them in my introduction to computer science (C++) class.   The reason, why this is the most memorable is because my previous Winternship was the first time I had a technical internship and I didn’t really have much experience in any programming language, as I took my first intro to computer science course in the spring semester. However, I got to learn Python as I was working on my project for the company I was assigned to (Exiger). The beauty of programming is that when you know one language it's easy to grasp the same idea and techniques to other programming languages, where you just need to work on syntaxes, as that differs from programming language to language. So, I got to apply the concepts I learned in Python to my introductory course (in C++), which made things a bit easier and because I already had a foundation in coding through my Winternship, I really enjoyed the class and discovered I have a passion for coding! ","   Majoring in computer engineering, a lot of my classes feel really isolating because of how male dominating they are, I’m usually the only female or one of the few in large lecture halls. There have been times where I felt discouraged continuing a path in the tech field because I thought what if my job place is as isolating as my classes and I can’t make friends/connections with more women in tech. However, through my previous Winternship experience I got to meet so many diverse women in tech who go through the same feelings and obstacles as me and it makes me feel more empowered to continue my computer engineering path by being in such an amazing community who is trying to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. Therefore, I would love and appreciate having the chance to learn in this environment and community again! ",Yes,Brooklyn,NY,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,Yes,"I feel underrepresented in some of my technical courses because there isn't a lot of women of color who are trying to be a part of the tech field like me and sometimes that does negatively impact me. But by participating in the Winternship last winter and attending the events, I truly feel empowered to be a part of a community where I can meet more women like me and not feel so alone in wanting to be a part of the tech industry.   As for skills, I have had experiences with different programming languages and feel confident that I could work in a new language that I haven’t had experience in if a company wanted me to. I also have experience in working with web frameworks like React and React Native and most importantly I am eager to learn new things! ",,,Humayara Karim,Humayara Karim,0,2,Yes,Yes

For instance, the first phone was made in the mid-1800s but there have been hundreds of more improvements made since then. As time goes on technology advances with us. ","This summer I had an internship with the Real Estate Board of New York. I was the team co-captain for the last week of the internship. I had to prepare a presentation for a property that my team and I were selling in theory. I worked with another team member to prepare the presentation. I did market research on the neighborhood of the property that we were selling. I attended office hours to ask questions because I was confused about where to get my research information from.

Ultimately, through all my efforts as a leader of the club, I am hoping to incorporate to the necessary cause of increasing the numbers of women in the field of engineering/technology.   To display the same morals above, I try to keep myself involved around campus with various other clubs as well, especially ones related to engineering. These include: Women in Computer Science, Society of Women Engineers, Engineers Without Borders, and UNICEF. I also am an active participator in STEM fairs and try to help out as best as I can to encourage more authentic individuals to join the same career road.  ",Yes,,,,F_XZMCSEuA64l0Nqh,Resume - Break Through Tech NY.pdf,89655,application/pdf,"When I imagine a career in technology, I can't help but be amazed at what a long way we have come. For example, phones went from no passcodes, to 4 digit pins, to suddenly unlocking with individualistic fingerprints. And now, their facial recognition systems continue to strengthen their security structure. We never know what the future with technology can hold, as anything is possible; and that is exactly what excites me when imagining a career in tech!   When I imagine a career in technology, I feel excited when I think about 3D Printing, remote surgery, floating gardens, autonomous flying vehicles, and internet for all - especially for those struggling in third world countries. I think about working with artificial intelligence, powerful softwares, and design automation. A career in technology always guarantees that I can be my innovative self in a place where creativity is welcomed. Having the choice to work across different functions and take on different roles so flexibly, is something that interests me in regards to my future.   When I imagine a career in technology, I feel moved by the possibility of a much safer world. One where a pandemic doesn't continue to take the lives of innocents. One where every child has access to free education. One where access to clean water sources is universal. One where mass hunger is no longer an issue and neither is healthcare for all. A world where technology flourishes is a world where all global issues can be resolved. And the thought of incorporating to these aspects makes me very excited and interested. I want to be able to break many conventional norms and help bring necessary change through my efforts in technology. A career in technology would constantly challenge me, and keep me on my toes to develop innovative solutions to significant issues - big or small. ","Working in groups and connecting with others is something I genuinely enjoy. If I had to recall a time where I demonstrated the true leadership and team collaboration, I would say it is when I was working with a group of 3 others during a 24 hour Hackathon coding event.   It was all of our first hackathon and we were notified of the categories the week before. Thus, our goal was to design a universal banking system that would allow users to seamlessly carry out their transactions for different banking institutions, all through one app. This fell under the category of business.   My contributions were that I was able to code the frontend of the banking system in C++ and display all the user actions correctly. I also took on the position of the team leader as I felt it was necessary. This was when 10 hours into the event, the Hackathon hosts decided to remove the business category our project fell under. This caused a lot of anxiety for my group as we were already halfway through the code. Half of the group wanted to abandon the event as they were stressed and demotivated with the change. I, however, did not feel like that would have been the right thing to do and just give up. This allowed me to take on the role of a leader and encourage the others in my group to not back out as even if we don't like we had hoped, we gave it our best.   Despite this sudden change, I was able to lead my group by suggesting we refrain from the business path and just create an app that would function as an ATM. It would allow the user to deposit money in checks and even order money to be withdrawn at a time. We also implemented a security check as a function that helped enforce a stronger system. Ultimately, these actions got us qualified to enter the hackathon judging process!   Although we did not win that event, it was all of our first time. Regardless of the curveball thrown our way, we were able to work collaboratively as a team and have each other's backs. This allowed me to learn how at times I will be put in uncomfortable or unexpected situations, but the way we choose to handle ourselves defines our work ethic. For the future, if I had to do something differently, I would have more backup ideas across different categories in mind in case a similar situation arises.  ","The purpose of internships (and Winternships!) are to allow students to directly explore the careers they are interested in pursuing. They provide real-world experience beyond the classroom environment, enabling students to determine their interests in that particular field. Thus, I want to participate in the Winternship program as I feel like it would be the best way for me to gain more insight into the career that awaits me post-graduation. Additionally, the experience from this Winternship would also allow me to learn new programming languages and softwares, or help me strengthen my current skills. This will be a very good experience to have under my belt for future internships and even my career.   My past experiences have given me some exposure as to what career I want to pursue, however, there are still other possibilities and fields within technology/computer science that interests me. This opportunity could open me up to other concentrations and companies I have never worked with such as Google, Linkedin, IBM! Or even bring me back to the old relations I formed during my past Winternship at Bloomberg! Either way, I would consider myself fortunate to be able to participate in the program.   Aside from my professional goals, the Wnternship program would also allow me to work towards my academic and personal goals. Academically, I want to apply my new knowledge from my classes and the new languages/softwares I have learned. This will allow me to apply that classroom taught knowledge into the real world and see the effects of my contribution. I would love to work on cutting edge technology such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, and many more! I want to develop new experiences as through my past experiences I have realized what I like and don't like, which is the sole purpose of an internship (or Winternship!). I think this program would be a wonderful short overview to something new I can get involved with, which may increase my interests in certain fields when applying for a summer or future opportunity.   Personally, I love to keep myself busy and this would be a great opportunity for me to learn about the culture of a new company through the program. Although obtaining technical skills are important for me, soft skills are just as essential in any job.   Ultimately, I want to gain substantial hands-on knowledge in other fields of tech before choosing one concentration for the remainder of my career, and I feel like there couldn't have been a better opportunity for this other than through the Break Through Technology's Winternship Program.  ","My time during my previous Winternship allowed me to gain substantial knowledge in terms of technical experience and exposure into the company's culture. I think it is safe to say that my Winternship experience actually helped me obtain my summer internship as it made me a more qualified candidate. I was able to expand my knowledge of Python post my Winternship, and even use it effectively in one of my projects during my summer internship! I also learned the how to seamlessly work within a group of individuals which allowed me to effectively work with a group of senior engineers during the summer internship. Despite technical skills however, the Winternship also taught me how to carry myself out professionally in a company setting. I was able to effectively apply that knowledge and skill in my time during the summer and create many meaningful connections.   Aside from the Winternship preparing me for my career opportunities, it has also increased my interest in my academic CS related courses. A lot of the things I learned in my classes, I had already knew from my Winternship and felt better prepared for the coursework.   My previous Winternship opportunity was truly one of the best experiences of my life and I wouldn't trade it for anything. But, I am hoping to obtain another Winternship this year so I can have another chance to showcase my skills and hopefully incorporate to the company's mission. I believe this will open many doors for me into my prospective future and help me in across numerous aspects.  ","All of Break Through Tech's efforts demonstrate their desire to close the gender gap in technology and opening new doors of opportunities for the minority group of women in the field. All of my past efforts and affiliations align exactly with Break Through Tech's mission, which is why I feel like I would be a perfect fit to learn and grow within this community. For example, I participate in many campus clubs and activities, all of whom promote the involvement of women in technology/engineering. These include Women's Robotics Club, Women in Computer Science, Society of Women Engineers, and Engineers Without Borders. My efforts in the Women's Robotics Club particularly has gotten me recognized enough to take on a leadership position. This allows me to better work towards my desire to increase the numbers of women in tech, by inducting as many female students into the club. Through my efforts in the academic year, I hope to organize many interesting events and projects to spark the interest of technology in newly recruited women.   My efforts in increasing the number of women in technology arise from my background and where I am from. Back there, like many other third world countries in South Asia, many girls are deprived of the right to education, let alone a career in tech. The sole purpose of a girl's existence there is revolved around her ability to take care of household chores, and ultimately get married to provide for her husband. Knowing the harsh reality that exists there motivates me to excel in my studies and career here as I have the resources and means to do so. Me succeeding in this field and encouraging other women to do the same, allows us to get closer to breaking such traditional stereotypes.   Essentially, my background, efforts, and dedication all align with Break Through Tech's initiatives in increasing the diversity in the technology industry. The community and environment that exists here is a place where I can see my dreams and aspirations taking off. If I was given the chance to be a part of the Winternship program this year, I would feel privileged to carry on Break Thru Tech's initiative forward through my commitment. ",Yes,Jackson Heights ,New York,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,Yes,,No,"My background allows me to feel stronger regarding the cause of closing the gender gap in tech as I went to a high school that centered around engineering, but it was extremely male-dominated. The ratio of male to female was 7 to 3, and sexism filled the air. There were a lot of critics and doubts regarding girls who were genuinely interested in this field during my time there. Due to this, many girls dropped out of the school's engineering program. However, I was able to overcome those barriers and be one of the only females to graduate top 5% of my class. I performed tasks such as aircraft engine changes, troubleshooting systems, and running engines. Despite the underrepresentation and lack of support in the environment, I was able to excel in a male dominant field and prove my worth as a woman.   Aside from that, I also lead an engineering honors society club at my school, increasing induction rates from just 200 to almost 350. These efforts helped draw in new students and introduce them to a career in engineering technology. Additionally, I also helped initiate a new program, ""Women in Engineering,"" which is a national organization that solely works to encourage the number of women in the field of engineering. That program has taken off post my graduation and it's great to see others continuing my efforts.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A point I feel like I should make clear is that many of my credits arise from transfer credit from high school, or simply unnecessary ones not counted towards my curriculum. Although those might be picked up by the system, I technically have approximately 61 credits towards my actual Computer Engineering curriculum. I still have a bit over half the credits to obtain towards my degree.   I am also graduating in 2023, because I soon will need to start working for financial reasons and might need to become a part-time student for some semesters. This will mean I will have to take less credits and postpone my curriculum completion. So, although system shows ""junior,"", I am actually doing a 5 year program and still have 3 more years to go.

",Yes,,,,F_1Fz9JnbcqqAdKxi,Main Resume-converted.pdf,283485,application/pdf,"     A career in tech is a career in innovation. From being used in businesses to create consumer products, to being used in the gaming industry, and to being used in the police force to monitor and surveillance, within the next few years, imagine what other aspects of life technology can bore into. Just imagine how different society was 10-15 years back when smartphones were still uncommon with dumb phones being used 70% by people; fast forward to 2015 and you get 8.6 million people living in New York City with 80% of us owning smartphones (Nahmias, Laura, 2015). Society changes fast when there is a breakthrough and our generation of computer scientists are here for that!      My interest in computer science sprouted more than 2 years ago when I was a sophomore and I can say that I am very passionate about this field and this career choice. When I first found out about computer science 2 years ago, I wasn’t like “oh there’s no job scarcity in this field” or the “damn that’s a great 6-figures right there”. Realistically, it was more like “hackers are so cool”, then as I progressed in learning some programming, I find it really satisfying. When you become so dissolved in coding and you lose your track of time, I find that so enthralling like I am in my own “void”. Starting from that point onwards, I genuinely believe computer science was meant for me. ","     I participated in my first ever Summer Blockchain Ideation Challenge this summer with a few other friends I teamed up with. It was step 3 of the challenge where the team and I had to create our business model canvas (BMC) to strategically manage our business idea. When the team and I got together remotely for our weekly meetings to discuss step 3, we were astonished by the surplus of work the assignment gave us that week. Instead of hesitating and leaving my team to figure out what to do on my own, I asked my team to spend the next half hour researching. After that, I let each of them pick their role to do for step 3. We went around doing that and then split the rest of the untouched work around once more until everyone gets a proportionate amount of work assigned.       The role I played during that week of the challenge involves leading (leader/facilitator) and monitoring. When the team got overwhelmed by the assignment listed for step 3 and did not know where to start on the canvas, I clarified the aims of the group and helped the group create an alternate subgoal (researching for half an hour). After the group members understood the concepts of the assignment, I officially started the meeting—monitoring/splitting the work equally amongst ourselves. Even though I think my contributions toward my group for step 3 of the challenge was well-done, I believe I should not have taken the initiative that early on. I should have sided more with the monitoring role and observe the group more while ensuring all group members have a chance to participate and learn. ","        If given the opportunity to participate in the Winternship program, I genuinely believe my participation in this program will be of great significance to me and to my future endeavors in the tech industry, personally, academically, and professionally. As a current freshman in college, I also believe that the key to success is to start as early as possible. That is why even though there are people around me telling me to slow down and to enjoy the college experience, I want to gain as much experience as possible to increase the likelihood of landing a tech job.  	Growing up, I have always been a good kid listening to my overprotective grandparents while my parents work in their take-out restaurant. I did well in school as I should, and I thought little of what I want to do in life. Looking back, my childhood had been serene. In fact, it was way too serene without unease. And serene, itself, does more harm than good. Serenity caused me to become lax in my environment, prohibiting me from leaving my comfort zone, which in my case, while being raised by overprotective grandparents, is a dislikable composite.  	My personal goal in applying for this Winternship program is to meet new networks of people from various walks of life and to break out of my “shell” to try new things. I regret not doing more in my high school years, but I hope my journey in college will help redeem myself. As for my academic goal, it has been pretty much the same since my youth. To gain and maintain, little by little. Another way to word this is to improve and to keep up the improvement in terms of academic grades. Finally, my professional goal is to start building projects to put on my portfolio to better “advertise” myself to tech companies. ",,"        I absolutely stand by the Winternship program’s goal of fostering a safe and inclusive community that prioritizes diversity and equality. I have long heard from the internships I have participated in that the organizations that hosted these internships are trying to minimize the gap between genders and to increase the number of women in the tech industry. I was not surprised actually…until I saw the numbers. Based on a Pew Research Center analysis of 2014-2016 American Community Survey (IPUMS), only about 25% of computer jobs in the STEM industry belong to women (“Diversity in Tech: We’ve Got a Long Way to Go”, n.d.). And the numbers for gender diversity in the industry is even more astonishing. The percentage of white employees at major tech companies is approximately 50% or more with Asian employees leading second. “The percentage of black and Hispanic employees at major tech companies is especially low, making up just one to three percent of the tech workforce. In total, the ratio of African Americans and Hispanics to coworkers is about half in the tech sector of what it is in the rest of the private sector” (“Diversity in Tech: We’ve Got a Long Way to Go”, n.d.).  	Participating in a program, not just for tech, that fosters a safe and inclusive community for racial diversity and gender diversity will benefit the students in the long run. It will minimize any feelings of inferiority or superiority within the community of students which makes me look forward to the program. It does not matter if you are this kind of race or this gender; no one will look down on you or think any less of you just because of that. I think that being fostered in this type of program should have been a must since early age because the older and older you get and the later and later one begins to become aware of this fact, the more indifferent one will be towards this prominent issue in tech.

This means you can start in one place and end up completely somewhere else. To me, tinkering with tech and software is like wood working. In my most recent activities, I have begone to work with photo and video editing software. However, I have stepped away from the adobe systems and begone to work with open source software. This means switching from Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop to RawTherapee and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). These are brand new software for me. However, as I like to tinker with technology it has been a rewarding learning experience and something that I enjoy.   Another reason that I am excited for a career in tech is because it fits the way my brain works. Along with creative open source software that I like to use, I am also naturally analytical minded. I like to work with data and statistics. I always knew from a young age that I saw things as numbers and statistics, however this became very apparent when I entered high school and college. I worked on a project that required me to collect data on students and sleep deprivation. I then had to compile the data and make both macro and micro conclusions. This was one of the biggest eye openers for me because I enjoyed working on this project. ","In my previous internship, I worked for the NYC Census. Our goal was to make sure that people in New York City filled out the 2020 Census. One of the ways we educated people on the importance of filling out the Census was by attending cultural events across NYC. However, the NYC Census fell into a large roadblock as the city was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was not possible for us to attend events with large gathers of people because of the risk. Instead we had to find other ways to contact people.   While analyzing the data and being a person of Bangladeshi origin, my coworkers and I realized that the Bangladeshi community in NYC was underrepresented in the Census. So, while working with the US Census Bureau and the Brooklyn public Library, my peers and I helped organize a zoom meeting. I reached out to Bangladeshi community organizations through social media and gathered an audience for the event. We successfully executed the event. If I were to do something differently, I would invite not just community organization but also friends and family to the event as well. ","The reason I want to participate in the Wintership program is because I want to gain experience in the tech industry. I have previously had internships in environments that require social skills and communication. I believe I have gained a lot of experience in that field. However, I wish to diversify my resume so that after I graduate from college, I have opportunities in multiple fields, from communication to tech. I believe the Wintership program would be beneficial to me because although I like to work with technology, I have never had an internship in technology before. The program will be able to fill this gap in my knowledge and make me a more rounded person with multiple skills.",,"The main reason that I want to learn in this environment is that although I am not a woman, I do come from an immigrant family.

My passion for Computer Science, however, did not get ignited until I got to High School.  I realized that a career in the field of Cybersecurity was the perfect blend of both of my passions.  We live in a world that is constantly advancing technologically in almost every way and that has revolutionized the way we live and operate through services such as online shopping, education and any other thing you can think of especially in light of the current pandemic where our physical access to many businesses has been quite limited. It is quite obvious that careers in technology are also becoming increasingly important. And as technology continues to evolve, we, as aspiring industry professionals are charged with the crucial yet exciting responsibility of ensuring that this growth in technology is well managed and utilized appropriately.  Careers in technology also tend to be male-dominated. It therefore excites and inspires me, as a woman to bring some diversity and alternative perspectives to this vast world of technology. ","This past winter, I interned at Cognizant Softvision along with 3 other young women.  We were given the task to develop an application that would help the company to effectively manage events held at their Hudson Yards studio. We were all hit with major imposter syndrome when we learned the specifications of the application that we were expected to build in three weeks- especially since none of us had prior experience with the software. My teammates and I all exhibited leadership roles throughout the entirety of our internship.  In my opinion the most important part of being a leader is developing a strong relationship with your team members because we are nothing without a team.  Throughout the weeks I learned about the girls on a personal level, when they began to get stressed and doubt themselves I was the one to bring the focus back around. I helped the team delegate tasks to make everything more manageable and we played on the strengths of every team member.  In the end we were able to build a functioning application that succeeded all of our expectations.  I came out of this internship mentally stronger than I was when I started.  So many life lessons were instilled in me there; I noticed how hard I would be on myself when things don’t go as planned and how much I underestimate my abilities. I believe that my self-doubt may have minimized our productivity, since I would overthink every decision and not work as efficiently as I am able to. This is why, moving forward, I would view every obstacle as an opportunity for learning while being more confident in everything that I do. ","As a woman of color in Tech, I am determined to do all in my power to succeed and become a role model for other young women who look like me but are intimidated to pursue this male-dominated career field.  My participation in this incredible program would be a huge advancement on my path to becoming a successful professional in this field. I am hopeful that this Winternship will help me to explore an exciting new sector of technology- since I explore Software Engineering in my last Winternship- and learn more about the complexities of this area.  The experience and knowledge obtained from this program would stimulate a specific interest in this sector, possibly urging me to seek further degrees or careers in this particular field.  Participating in this program will also allow me to network with many industry professionals and potential mentors from whom I will learn a great deal. Being an extrovert, I thrive on social interaction, and I am getting excited just imagining the things that the other participants and I will learn from each other if I am granted the opportunity to participate.  I believe that being amongst peers who share similar interests and educators to mentor us will equip me with the necessary skills to become a successful technology professional and mentor to other women of color in Tech. ","I began working as a Mathematics Tutor at Brooklyn Science and Engineering Academy through the CUNY Tutor Corps program and it has been such a rewarding experience. A lot of the interpersonal skills that were strengthened at my Winternship made me a much better tutor. It is very fulfilling to be able to positively impact a child’s life.  This feeling further fueled my passion to become a mentor to other young women who look just like me but are intimidated by joining this male-dominated field.  I am also a member of the Honors Program and received a 4.0 and 3.93 GPA for my last two semesters earning me a spot on the Dean’s List, for the fourth semester in a row.  I was able to apply some technical skills that I learned last winter in my various classes such as Computer Algorithms and even Cryptography.  Although in the midst of this global pandemic, I had a very productive summer and achieved many accomplishments that would push me further towards my goals.  I was also a finalist for the Foreign Affairs Information Technology (FAIT) Fellowship, a fellowship that provides undergraduate and graduate students in IT-related fields with tuition assistance, mentorship and professional development, to launch their careers in the Foreign Service as Information Management Specialists.  Since I am now halfway through my degree, I began thinking about what I wanted to do for Graduate school and while exploring the option of doing a PhD, I applied to two research programs (Cornell Tech’s SoNIC Summer Research Program and John Jay’s PRISM Undergraduate Research Program), both of which I was accepted to.  I believe that the clear presentation of the skills I gained at my internship on my resumé put me at a great advantage to be selected for these programs.  Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SoNIC Summer Research Program was cancelled.  However, I began conducting research in Cyber Threat Intelligence with my mentor Dr. Aftab Ahmad of John Jay College through the PRISM Undergraduate Research Program and I am already learning so much. This Fall, I begin working as a Data Science Fellow in the CUNY Tech Prep Program and I am so excited about learning all about it.  Usually, to be considered for CUNY Tech Prep, you would need to complete the Data Structures course- which I did not.  However, because of my experience at this year’s Winternship, that requirement was waived for me because the recruiters recognized the skills I gained through the internship. ","In addition to the reasons stated in my previous answers about why I am passionate about being a woman of color in tech and why I think it is important, I believe that this community is immensely empowering and supportive.  My last Winternship was one of my most memorable experiences and I enjoyed every minute of those three weeks.  Prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, my teammates and I kept in touch constantly and went out together several times.  We developed an amazing bond where we help each other out in any way we can.  In my last team, there was one freshman, two sophomores and a junior and we were all able to give each other help in various courses that we may have taken before or had a better understanding of.  But apart from the technical aspects, we encourage each other in every way and offer support to one another when someone is feeling down.  I love the feeling of knowing I’m not alone in this field because sometimes I can get lost in my thoughts and doubts when something goes wrong.

It involved the use of React (which I was lightly familiar with), React-redux, and PostgreSQL (neither of which I had any familiarity with), among other things. Since we had to produce two apps we decided to split into two groups, one for the front end and the other for the back end. I decided to work with one other student on the back end since it had been the least covered topic in the class and I thought it would be a good opportunity to challenge myself. We also assumed it would be the harder of the two apps and thus had to assign more manpower to it. Most of our time was spent researching the subject and checking each other's work when our efforts initially failed. Eventually we realized that we had underestimated the complexity of our front end and I had to assist our remaining team member. We ended up learning quite a bit more than we had working on simpler assignments, despite the stress of having to learn multiple skills within the two weeks we had before the deadline. Ultimately our biggest problem came when trying to connect the apps we had developed independently. In retrospect, it is clear that a team effort should not be split into smaller teams with minimal communication and if I had to do the project again, I would take communication much more seriously or make sure that all members of the team have an understanding of the entire project, not just the part they worked on.","My professors have repeatedly stated that a computer science degree provides foundational knowledge, but not necessarily real world experience, i.e. that it is not all about programming. I like that aspect of the major, since the material taught has wider applications than the few popular programming languages that might be taught in a bootcamp. However, I think I would have a better understanding of the abstract material taught in class, if I were familiar with its real world application. The structure and guidance provided by the Winternship program seems to make ideal for gaining real world experience while grounding abstract ideas.",,"Learning in an inclusive environment would alleviate the feeling of being an impostor that one often feels in academic or professional spaces. It creates an environment much more conducive to learning, since one would not feel the need to focus on how they are perceived by their colleagues. Inclusivity also fosters a wider range of ideas, which also greatly enhances the learning experience.

On top of that, technology is always advancing and I find it fascinating to see them grow and my potential in working on these technologies that may seem to be far out in the future. ","During a hackathon, I had the privilege to work with a team of 4. Our goal was to create an application that would show whether or not an advertisement objectified women or not. The theme of the hackathon was ‘Change’ and we wanted to change the way women are perceived in the media. Before we came to this decision to take this approach for the hackathon we had many other ideas and could not decide on which one to go for. During our brainstorming, I made sure to listen to all my teammate’s ideas and made sure to get a full understanding of the possibilities and potential of each idea. This was a very good way of deciding which idea to go along with. My part of the project was working on the UX design using javascript, I would discuss with my teammates what I thought the best approach to the design would be and welcome their feedback. Since the hackathon was time-restricted, we would feel stressed at times when our code would not work the way it should be;  but we all pushed through and made sure to keep a positive mindset. Next time I am on a team for a hackathon I would definitely want to try agile project management so that everyone on the team would be able to stay organized and less stressed due to the time. ",My goals are to build connections with the people at my Winternship program and team so that I can have the support to learn and also encourage others to learn through my experience. I want to learn as much as I can from my peers and find out specific interests I have in technology. ,"Winterships did not only give me valuable technical skills but it also enlightened me on working in an office setting and how a company works. In my previous winternship at Aetna, I learned a lot about corporate social responsibility and being able to work with multiple teams together to create a product that will benefit its users. This summer, I was able to remotely intern at Verizon as a front-end developer. Since the internship was remote I did not feel the connection was made as it would have been if the internship was in person. I made sure to use the communication skills I learned through my winternship to communicate with my team members to create a virtual setting in which we felt welcomed and free to discuss and work on our project. On top of that, since learning about social corporate responsibility, I made sure to join volunteer opportunities the company would host. ",Winternships always leaves me inspired to learn more about the technology field. I love how Winterns get to work together with other students who also may be going through the same technological path. It allows us to motivate each other and push ourselves to go above and beyond.

I created multiple java classes which were incorporated into the Chatbot through a shared gitlab.   Deploying them to the Chatbot took some time, because later we realized that the code needed to be approved in order for it to be deployed (which our manager didn’t realize until later as well). Although I created many java classes that ended up being deployed, I think something I would do differently is to focus more on what I can do then what I appeared to not have any control over. I think I could have created many more java classes to make the Chatbot have even more capabilities, but with time constraint I wasn’t able to add those extra capabilities.","I want to participate in the Wintership program, because I want to further my experience with computer science and technology because it is something I am passionate about.

With a career in tech, I look forward to building applications that can help others. I want to work as a data scientist and analyze data in order to provide a user with the optimal experience. In addition to working as a data scientist, I am also interested in a career in cybersecurity. I want to make sure that a user’s interaction isn’t disrupted by any security issues in the system. But besides this, I’m also excited about how changes in the tech industry. Technology is evolving everyday and because of this, everyday in the tech industry will allow for something new - new ideas, new people, new designs. I also love the fact that in this industry, you don’t have to know everything in order to succeed. People are always learning and adapting to all the new ideas that arise everyday. There is a place for everyone to thrive and there is no one size fits all package for a career in tech and the welcoming spirit of the industry is why I would love to have a career in tech.","In high school, I played on my school’s lacrosse team as a midfielder. There were only three players, out of the thirty, who already knew how to play. I was one of those who didn’t. Despite the fact that most of us didn’t know how to play, we were still able to grow as a team. We were able to take on some teams that were more experienced than we were. Thus, our goal for the season was just to have a good time and to have something to do outside of our classes. As a midfielder, my job was to bring the ball from the defenders down the field to the attackers in order to score a point. I also had to communicate with other midfielders to pass them the ball so I wouldn’t have to end up running down the entire field. Next time, I think it would be cool to have a bunch of different plays to improve our gameplay. Additionally, I think that with any team, our communication could be improved. In addition to the great plays we had, there were also times where I felt that we could’ve talked to each other more on the field so that we could have some more great plays. But, playing on this team has taught me a lot. It has taught me how to speak to people, how to work with people, and how to get things done, all of which I think are important skills to have.","I think that there are many benefits to participating in the Winternship program. As a minority in the tech industry, participating in this program would help me launch my career so that I can accomplish all that I want to accomplish. I think that it would also be a good opportunity for me to meet other underrepresented groups who are like me. Participating in the Summer Guild has introduced me to others who were also interested in the tech industry, some of which are in my classes now. By participating in the Winternship program, I would be able to make connections with those who are also trying to start their careers, as well as those who have already gotten started. Furthermore, the Winternship program would give me a risk-free opportunity to see which field of tech I’m interested in. Currently, I am debating between data science and cyber security; with a winternship, I could explore one of the two and see if I’m genuinely interested in it. Being a freshman, there is still so much time for me to figure out what I enjoy and if I were able to do so during a Winternship, I would be able to further focus my studies geared towards that field. ",,"Coming from a STEM major in high school, there were never many women in my classes - less than one-third to be exact. For two years, I was one of 8 females in my math major classes. I never would’ve imagined that there would be that many women interested in a STEM field until I participated in Summer Guild where I have met many kind, hardworking, and intelligent women.  I want to learn in a community of underrepresented groups in the tech industry because we are often overlooked. Despite the fact that we are just as capable, men are often given the jobs. By learning in a community of the underrepresented and overlooked, we can build a community where we support each other so that we can all work towards equality, so that we can get the skills we need, so that we will no longer be overlooked.

Our goal was to put on a play, as we were a cast. As the lead role of the play, I had to step up and do my part plenty of times. Many parts of the play relied on my character, so I made sure I learned and memorized my lines, showed up to rehearsals, and actively participated. As well as this, I also helped cast mates with anything they needed, whether that be rehearsing lines with them or filling in for them if they couldn't make it to rehearsal. If I had the chance, one thing I would do differently is be more open to socializing on the first day.

The specific goals of the projects differ from class to class but they all had the same general goal of creating a well constructed product that met all the assignment requirements. Most of the time, I contribute ideas for the project as well as help keeping track of and organizing other group members' ideas. I rarely attempt to become a team leader, I more enjoy creating the product rather than directing how the product is created. However, with that being said, I do regret where in situations where no one elects to become a leader and the whole project is completed without one, that I do not step up to become a leader. No matter how big or small a project may be, there needs to be a leader to help dictate what needs to be done in order to accomplish our goal. Without that lead person, the project becomes much more difficult to complete than with one.","I want to participate in the Winternship program because I would love to gain experience in the the tech field as it would better prepare me for the future, when I do graduate and I am in search of jobs.

I loved the school and the people there, but the school was predominantly male and white, which is a very honest representation of the tech industry. Due to the school's lack of diversity, I was usually one of the few black students in the classroom or one of the few women in the classroom, and as a result I often felt uncomfortable displaying any type of confusion I may have had in my classes. By feeling that way, I made my life much more stressful than it had to be. Although I would probably have to deal with that level of discomfort in the future due to the makeup of the tech industry, I was not ready to subject myself to that feeling so soon, especially since I was so far from home and had no one to guide me and help me feel less alone. So, I made the tough decision to transfer to Hunter for Spring 2020. I am very happy with my decision and I can already feel the difference in how it affects my learning. My classes at Hunter are much more diverse than those at my last school, and that one difference has aided me tremendously in my studies.

I joined the club in 2018, as a secretary. When I was the secretary of the club, I created and distributed monthly newsletters via MailChimp. The newsletters informed our members about the events that the club is in the process of planning and advertised events that have already been planned. This increased the engagement rate of our members by 20 percent. It also caused our social media platforms to gain an average of 3 to 5 followers or viewers every week. After being the secretary of the club for a whole academic year, I was promoted to the position of the president of the club last year. As the president of the club, I collaborated with my treasurer to write budget proposals that helped Women’s Robotics secure two thousand dollars in funding through various organizations such as WiTNY (now known as Break Through Tech), CCNY Undergraduate Student government, and CCNY Grove School of Engineering. We used that funding to organize a series of Arduino workshops, where students learned the basics of Arduinos, were able to light up an LED and turn on a motor using Arduinos. Additionally, I made sure that I taught skills such as using MailChimp to send out monthly newsletters to the current secretary of the club. This led to an additional increase of 20 percent in the engagement rate of our members. Moreover, my team also made sure that part of the funds was allocated towards organizing similar workshops in low-income communities. We donated two Arduino Uno kits to one of our eboard members. She uses them to teach the basics of Arduinos to children in her local community. Last year, my team organized a networking event with representatives from Verizon, for STEM majors at City College of New York. Ninety-five percent of our club members attended the workshop and had a higher chance of securing an internship at Verizon and other tech companies since during the workshop they learned how to properly tailor their resumes and cover letters for an internship or full-time opportunity at Verizon, as well as about the technical interview process that they need to go through in order to secure an internship or full-time position at Verizon. I strongly believe that students in every community should have the resources to gain an excellent education and make a continuous effort to provide as many students as I can with the resources such as Arduino workshops, that allows them to gain hands-on experiences, experiences which students are unable to gain in a traditional classroom.",Yes,,,,F_2Y5OZkBBrA1zo4i,Anam_Munawar_Resume.pdf,79491,application/pdf,"Technology is closely tied to every aspect of our lives and it enables us to quickly and efficiently make positive impacts on those around us. I am excited about a possible career in the technology industry because similar to Dave Guarino, I want to make a positive impact on people’s lives. A slight improvement in San Francisco’s system made it easier for many low-income families to register for public benefits. Guarino designed a version of San Francisco's system that did not exist before, a version of the system that changed the lives of thousands of people. Having a career in technology will empower me to design a new system or to improve an existing one to positively impact people’s lives. Whether it be creating an application that spreads awareness about sexual assault or an application that aids homeless people in locating nearby shelters. Building a career in the technology industry will empower me to improve products and systems that will positively impact people’s lives.","As an intern at Citi, I was paired up with four other undergraduate students to work on a project that was designed to digitize the experience of opening a bank account at Citi. Since our internship was cut a week short due to paperwork issues, we did not get a chance to bond as a team and we were assigned to work on a project on our first day. This caused issues when it came to deciding our approach as well as our timeframe. For example, one of my team members wanted to use a website called Glitch to write and compile our code while the others did not trust the security of the website. Another team member wanted to get done with the project as quickly as possible so she could focus on learning about Citi’s culture. On the other hand, the rest of my teammates wanted to distribute networking and work on the project evenly throughout the two weeks. With only a week left in the presentation, these differences were causing my teammates to get frustrated and make inappropriate comments towards each other. In order to resolve the conflict, I started by speaking to both of my team members which helped me understand their point of view of the situation. Then, I sent a group text to all of my team members, asking if they can stay for thirty minutes after work to do some team-building exercises. By the end of the week, we were able to finish the project in a timely manner as well as give an engaging presentation. ","My goal for participating in the Winternship program is to improve my ability to present in front of a large group, network with the other winterns and professionals, as well as improve my problem solving and coding skills. I believe that I will be able to achieve these goals because as a part of the winternship, I will be able to collaborate with others to complete a challenging project that the company will assign to us. If I am familiar with the programming language that the company uses, I will be able to build upon my knowledge by using that programming language to solve a real-world issue. If a programming language is used that I am not familiar with, it will be an opportunity for me to learn something new and add it to my skill set. Additionally, I will be able to network with professionals and ask for informational interviews which will help me learn about different roles and areas that I can work in, in the technology industry. I know that through this Winternship program I will be empowered to complete my goals and leave a lasting mark in the program. ","While interning at Penguin Random House, I faced the challenge of learning a new scripting language called PowerShell. I had to learn Powershell in order to write a script that automates the onboarding process of new hires by allowing the user to create a new Office 365 mailbox and modify the Active Directory account based on the mirror user at Penguin Random House. I used techniques such as proactively asking questions during team meetings, and watching PowerShell tutorials during my personal time to learn more about PowerShell and complete my project in a timely manner. Additionally, interning at Citi last year sparked my interest in the FinTech industry and motivated me to attend the Ignite Summit and a Tech Crash Course organized by Capital One. I have also been able to use my presentation and teamwork skills that I gained through my winternship experiences to be an effective president of the Women’s Robotics Club. As president, it was my responsibility to organize events with other clubs on campus and with companies such as Verizon for our club members. Moreover, the relationships that I have made through previous winternship programs have been really helpful when it comes to staying connected and building meaningful relationships with established professionals. ","I have had professors who would not acknowledge my presence in a room, or answer questions I had about the material. I have had members of other clubs tell me that if  Women’s Robotics’ club members want to share the room, then we need to be fine with 3-D printed inappropriate images laying all around our workspace. I have watched my club members work in the lobby, and store supplies in another club’s room because they did not feel comfortable working in the room which they had the right to be in. Despite these challenges, I was able to help the vice president of the club secure a lab room for our club members to work and store their materials in, and as a result, my club members were able to complete two projects last year. These experiences bring to light my motivation for wanting to participate in this Winternship program.   I want to learn in a safe and inclusive environment because I want to meet women from diverse backgrounds and learn more about their journey within the technology industry. I want to connect with women who are as passionate about technology as I am and serve as a mentor for those who are not sure about a career in the technology industry based on their previous experiences.

Computer science, software design, and computer engineering can be applied to the medical, business, and public relations sectors. Since most of today's world revolves around the use of tech, it is very exciting to seek a career that either revolves or involves in tech. For example, my preferred major is accounting, however, part of my majors requirements is to complete a Information Systems and Tech prerequisite. Additionally, many combined BBA/MA programs include a bachelors in accounting and a masters in computer information and systems. The reason this interests me is because with such a degree I could be both involved in the business aspect of my career as well as the analytical and software related aspect. ","Since June 2017 - 2019, I was part of the Discovery Guide Program at the Prospect Park Zoo. This program was part of the education department which was responsible for educating the public on the mission of the Wildlife Conservation Society. The Discovery Guide team educated the public through interactive and engaging activities,game, and lectures that were suited for all ages. As part of our duties at the zoo, were were responsible for ensuring the safety for both the animals and visitors at the zoo. Our goal was not just to educate the public about the importance of animal conservation, but also to interact with families and provide them with an welcoming and warm environment at the zoo. My main responsibilities on the team was to interact with the public at one of the zoos many quest stations. These stations had different levels of engaging activities, lessons and lectures. Every day I would interact with over 250 people on average. During the summer of 2019, I was nominated for the Discovery Guide Leaders Program which increased my responsibilities as a team member. As can be seen by the title, I became a mentor/leader for the Discovery Guide program. This program added a new set of leadership responsibilities to my previous ones which included: narrating daily sea lion training and feeding demonstrations, mentoring new Discovery Guides, running morning meetings, assisting with Discovery Guide enrichment classes, and keeping track of Discovery Guides during the day. Since each year there would be different volunteers at the program I would meet new people and share my experiences with them. Usually each day we had around 10 - 14 team members who would be spread around the zoo educating the public. We got along very well and we really formed a bond with each other as we engaged with the public on different activities. If I had to do something differently it would be to teach other members the importance of respect. Often times, there some struggles between members of the team due to disagreements. I would often loose track of these arguments and the program coordinator would have to personally stop these arguments. Next time I would stop these arguments myself in time and pay close attention to any disputes that might happen with members of the team. ","As I previously described in a different question, my career goal is to go into business - specifically accounting. Accounting is a profession which requires knowledge in information and analytics which often false under the tech category. From previous classes in high school such as my HTML class and Robotics class, I really enjoyed working with computer software's as well as learning how to use the Arduino Pi. Also from some of my personal hobbies, which include game development on the Roblox platform, I learned to basics of Lua Coding as well as utilizing the 3D making studio. I would classify myself as an expect CSG Modeler on the Roblox platform. To sum things up, the goal of me participating in the program is to learn and find opportunities to somehow combine my accounting major with a tech field. In simple terms, see if there are alternatives to my interest in business. ",,"I strongly believe in inclusion of all sexes and races into different professions and fields.

Despite it being my first Hackathon, I had a great experience. My team and I won the Social Impact Track with our website that was designed to address the problems women face in male-dominated industries. ",Yes,,,,F_1252XNUBpV1saDj,Sonel Rubinstein Fall 2020 Resume  (1).pdf,78732,application/pdf,"As we’ve seen these past few months, the world can change overnight. A career in tech interests me because change pushes for new technology. From the accelerated use of Zoom to digital payments, technology has been a major component of this pandemic. With the world-changing, technology has the power to change with it. Hence, I’m interested in pursuing a career in tech because it’s dynamic. As somebody who enjoys learning, I value that there is always something new to discover with technology. It’s exciting for me to think about a career in tech where I can constantly be challenged to grasp new concepts and acquire new skills. Additionally, a career in tech is interesting because there are so many directions one can take. From my past experiences, I’ve seen how technology is used by law firms and banks. I enjoy the fact that having a career in tech allows me to explore different fields.","A majority of team projects I’ve been a part of have always been with people my age. It was only until this summer that I experienced working with people who were 20+ years older than me. While it was nerve-wracking at first, working with this team ended up being a highlight for my summer.   As part of my summer internship, I was supposed to create roadmaps for my company’s technology products. This required me to work with the team that manages the company’s technology applications. Our goal was to identify any product features or enhancements that could be put on our roadmap that would ultimately benefit the company over the next 12-18 months. My role in this project was researching everything about these technology products. Each week, I researched different things about the products: where they were in the marketplace, if there were any possible improvements, etc. From there, I would take all my research and have weekly meetings with my team where we would discuss what information was relevant to the roadmap. In the end, we ended up identifying over 30 roadmap items for the company to pursue.   Despite the age gap, I really enjoyed working with my team. They welcomed me with open arms and were always there to help. I believe it’s because we had great communication that allowed us to be successful. We had brainstorming sessions, actively listened to each other, and always made sure to respect each other's opinions.   For next time, one thing I would do differently is not shy away from asking questions. Occasionally, there were moments where I wanted additional clarification on a task. Unfortunately, I got nervous to ask these questions because I didn’t want to waste my teammate's time or seem like I didn’t know what was going on. Looking back now, I realize that there is nothing wrong with asking questions. Not knowing the answer is okay because it means there is room for you to learn. ","I want to be a part of the Winternship program because of the great experience I had the first time I participated. From that experience, I really valued getting to speak with professionals in a field I’m interested in. It was also comforting for me to hear that not all of them majored in CIS. This allowed me to understand that not everybody has a clear journey into technology as people will all come from different interests. In terms of goals, I would love to become more assertive. In a field like technology, you have to believe in your ideas and be confident enough to share them. While I do try to voice my opinions, there are times I stay silent because I fear I’ll come across too passive or aggressive. Hence, I want to use the Winternship program to help me become more assertive and stick up for my ideas. ","My previous Winternship experience was the first time I was exposed to Information Systems (IS). Before then, I thought a career in technology meant being a software engineer. However, from those three weeks, I saw that’s not the case. I became interested in IS because I found it to focus on the intersection of business and technology.  Because I’m majoring in Economics, IS became a field I wanted to explore more of after my Winternship. Thus, I started to apply for different IS summer internships. Fortunately, I was able to land a virtual internship in the IT department of a bank. I believe my Winternship experience helped me obtain that internship because it gave me something to talk about during my interview; I discussed how my Winternship introduced me to IS and how I wanted to study more of it. I’m now looking for other opportunities in IS, and I’m grateful that my previous Winternship put me on that path. My Winternship also inspired me to take a coding class this semester. I remember all the girls in my Winternship group knew Python. While I learned a little Python last summer, I’m definitely a beginner. When I told my teammates this, they encouraged me to take an Introduction to Python course. Hence, that’s what I’m doing this Fall! ","One thing I appreciated from my past Winternship was my team. It was the first time I worked with other women interested in technology. While we were all different, we were connected through our love for the field. I want to learn in a safe and inclusive community because I saw firsthand how powerful such a community is. The women on my Winternship team were driven, empathetic, and talented. In just three weeks, I learned so much from them both professionally and personally. Their passion for technology motivated me to work hard with them. Through this environment, I was learning from the next generation of technologists, which I would love to do again. ",Yes,Brooklyn,New York,Yes,US Citizen,,,,,,,,,No,No,No,"As I'm taking my first coding class this semester, I already feel the Imposter Syndrome sinking in. ""Am I good enough for this class? Do I even belong here?"" These are some of the thoughts that have been entering my mind. I can't help but compare myself to the males in my class who've been coding since they were young. However, I won't let my self-doubt stop me from doing well. I'm determined to learn as much as I can from the course, and I won't let Imposter Syndrome get in the way.",,,Sonel Rubinstein,Sonel Rubinstein,0,2,Yes,Yes

The ways in which these two are connected are numerous, even within each other, but the main idea which stands out to me is their universality. Neither is bounded by mental nor physical barriers, whether it be capability or physical borders across the world; as long as you wish to do it, you can do it - anywhere, any time. There are no boundaries as to a difference in languages, nor to how and what you wish to do with it. The flexibility of tech also allows me to combine any of my interests with tech and to work in any field I want - whether I wish to work in the art field, or end up in music, data, etc. This is why I believe that those in tech are unstoppable, and why I wish to pursue a career in it.","Last year, when asked to create a group coding project for class, my team and I separated our roles at the very start, along with setting deadlines and following up with each other, allowing for a smooth process. The most important part was communication, which was helpful because we could also help each other out when stuck. For the project, the part I took on was the UI/UX portion because I felt it to be the job most suitable for me based on my art background, but if it were not for a class project, I would have preferred to have tried some of the back-end coding in order to challenge myself and learn new skills. ","I believe that each and every opportunity to experience the workplace is precious, and the Winternship program, although short, is an amazing opportunity to learn more about different sections of the tech field and find a place where I want to develop toward. The tech field has thousands of different jobs, whether it be software engineers to media managers, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity, as well as the time when I’m still a student, to learn more about the vast different possible careers. Last Winternship, under an amazing mentor, I was able to learn a lot about project management, and this winter, I want to experience many other aspects to the tech field which I have never even imagined before.","The biggest skill I was able to learn during my previous Winternship was networking. Networking to me is not a teachable skill, but one that is learned, and through the Winternship, I was able to break out of my shell and reach out to multiple mentors and create connections which I wasn’t able to before my Winternship. Because I’d always found it awkward to contact previous co-workers or mentors after the programs were over, I had never done so, but after the Winternship, I felt more comfortable to reach out and reconnect with some previous teachers and mentors. Although this is just a small step, from a person who was shy and afraid to ask questions, the Winternship helped me learn and open up as a person.","As an Asian American woman, I can often walk into a tech company and count the number of people who look like me on my hands.

During the 3 days that we worked our goal was to create a program which would utilize live twitter data to notify you of potential forest fires in your area, and then send you text messages notifying you of the potential danger. We used multiple api's to scrape data from twitter, send you text messages and IBM's natural language processing to process the data we scraped in order to get a sentiment of what exactly the tweets were discussing. Long story short the program didn't work as well as we had hoped but we learned a lot.

At the time the project was quite ambitious for the time frame and the skill level of the group, also since our group had only studied programming up to that point in c++ maybe we should've stuck with it rather than utilizing python, but all these potential mistakes really got us to learn, which in hind sight was a good thing even though the final application we presented was flawed.","I feel that I'm unprepared to get a job in software engineering, I have some major gaps in my understanding of how code is written in a work environment.

As an Asian student, I do often tend to judge others based on grades even if I know that I should not.

Three, after acquiring a BA in Psychology a couple years back, I realized how little that degree is worth in comparison to one in computer science. My career goal at the moment is to make enough money to support myself as well as my family to a comfortable living just as they had provided for me.

Our last assignment was to build a website to help people. My group, including two other girls, decided to design a website that would help people with mental health problems they may be facing. It was a basic website. A lot of research went into the project/ We included a list of resources for help and suicide prevention, some breathing exercises and meditation that people could follow to calm themselves down, an image of a chat (since we couldn't figure out how to program a chat ourselves) so people could talk to actual people who are going through the same thing, and (my personal touch) a button that would give you a randomized motivational quote when clicked. We each had our jobs. Mine was to help with some of the coding, while the others did layout or helped with other parts of the coding (one girl even added calming music to the website that you could turn off or on to your liking). I am especially proud of the button I had coded because I'd implemented things I'd learned from the guild and from my experience with coding prior by using a randomized Array so every time you clicked the button, something new would pop up. What I'd do differently next time would be to figure out how to add more tabs to the website. The one we'd created together was beautiful and efficient, but it was only the one tab. It was very basic. Now that I have slightly more experience with coding, I'm sure I could make the website even more advanced, with a section where you can email us for any questions, an about page, a separate page for contacts and chat, and I'd like to improve my quote button to take quotes from another website (obviously sourcing the original website) instead of writing out each quote into the code.",I want to participate in the Winternship program to gain more experience under my belt.

A couple of my teammates and I handled the design of the robot, we build small prototypes, had multiple rough sketches of the robot, and ran trial and errors. The design process of the robot was fun because there were many options on how to build it, we discussed endlessly and when we finally settled on one design, we built it. Building the robot was most exciting, tools, screws, and beams were everywhere and it felt thrilling putting it all together and creating a functioning entity that could conquer the challenge. I contributed a lot to constructing our robot and kept track of instabilities while running tests. I never stopped thinking of ways to improve our robot because I knew it wasn't the best design although everyone was content with it. In the end, we made it to states where we unfortunately lost, I realize that I should have researched more about robot designs, any stable shapes and also loopholes I can find online or in books instead of constantly thinking. I found out, with greater knowledge comes a broader mindset and that will allow me to come up with a better design.

Up until recently, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue as a career. I constantly spent hours every week trying to find my place in society. One of the biggest demands for myself was that I wanted to help and improve humanity (kind of cliche, I know). Whether that meant physically saving lives, or making individuals lives more enjoyable, I knew that was my goal. In high school, I had the great opportunity to take AP Computer Science, and a college now course in Computer Science Principles. From that point on, my affection and devotion for the tech industry erupted. I soon came to realize the power coding held. Anything you could possibly think of could be created to your desire. Not only are you able to create interesting programs, the opportunities in this field are endless. Whether it be coding for a game, creating an app, or even programming machinery for a hospital, you directly have an impact on the lives of millions of individuals. I one day too hope to be able to code/create my own game or app to bring enjoyment to millions of individuals around the world. Along with this, my biggest passions in life is to be continuously learning. Throughout high school, I constantly challenged myself to learn more. I applied for AP and college now classes, joined multiple clubs, and spent the extra hours I had in the week to learn something new. The tech industry is constantly improving and building upon itself. Pursuing a career in the tech industry would not only mean that I get to pursue my passion of technology, but I also get the opportunity to be constantly growing as a person. It is a field that continues to improve and remains to be fully explored, I'm positive a career in the tech industry won't go by dully.      ","During my Junior year of high school, I competed in a school wide carpentry competition. The goal of the competition was to frame the exterior of a miniature house as accurately (according to a blueprint) and quickly as possible. Each team was composed of about 4-5, and they all competed to win a prize. During the span of the competition, I spontaneously took on the role of the ""team leader"". In my team of 5, I believe I was the most educated and experienced in the carpentry field. Therefore, I assigned my partners key parts of the project they were responsible for and assisted anyone if necessary. However, once the competition ended, I realized I didn't fully enjoy and take in the time we spent together. Next time, I would do as I did earlier, but instead take time to truly enjoy it. ","I would like to participate in the Winternship program to gain more insight into the tech industry. For the past couple of years, I have been focusing solely on the academic portion of school. I would like to get the opportunity to expand my horizons and gain real-world experience in the tech industry. Along with this, I believe the program would be a great opportunity to meet other fellow students interested in the tech world, and possibly even create a long-lasting friendship. Also, I believe that this program would be a great way to challenge myself and test my capabilities. Finally, if I have the opportunity of attending the program, it would look extremely well on my resume, and might even help me land more internships/jobs in the future to come. ",,"Exposure to diversity is extremely important for individuals. Interacting with individuals of different backgrounds and genders helps you grow as a person and get exposed to new thoughts, ideas, and perspectives.

I believe Sikhs are underrepresented in society. They are often labeled and grouped in with Indians, when we are absolutely apart from them. Stereotypically, the tech sector is dominated with Indians. Due to this, Sikhs usually face hardships finding jobs/positions in tech companies since many companies want to be diverse.

My teammate would then call me out and told me to ""keep making call-outs"". If I had the chance to do it over again, I would make sure my call-outs never stopped in the first place.
